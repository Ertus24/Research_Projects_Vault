**RECORDING 24/10/23 - 6:32pm****:**  
-certainty isn't possible  
-because to get certainty, you'd have to search the entire search space  
-the search space is always _{is it}_ combinatorially explosively large
 
-deductive logic works in terms of certainty  
**-so if the basis of deductive logic is certainty, which is impossible, how do we use it**  
-because we definitely do
 
**-we do that by assuming that A & B ARE true - which means that we are necessarily shrinking the problem space**  
-we are creating a [micro-world](Dreyfus%201979%20-%20From%20Micro-Worlds%20to%20Knowledge%20Representation%20AI) in order to be able to do that  
-which means that we are basically applying relevance realisation
 
-A: all men are mortal  
-B: Socrates is a man  
-C: therefore, Socrates is mortal
 
-we cannot be certain that A & B are both true  
**-but we can be** **pretty fucking sure** **based on what is REASONABLE** **- which is perfectly fine and works really well MOST OF THE TIME**  
-which comes back to David Chapman's Reasonable-ness (though not sure I should entirely equate the 2)  
-need to stress the point that I am not at all saying that our everyday ways of dealing with things is bad  
-we should respect and rely on Reasonability (need to come up with a better term for it)  
-**because we do rely on it, and it** **works****, most of the time**  
-that’s what JV says too "you intelligently ignore most things, and most of the time it works" - its clearly, not even just adequate, but actually **quite miraculous**  
-the fact that we're able to navigate this extremely complex environment, which we don't think of as complex because its just obvious what we should do most of the time (which is itself [i.e. generating obviousness] miraculous) is actually miraculous
 
-need to add the importance of REASONABLE to my set of cards
 
-this is another link in the chain, and an important one, because people are likely to say im just a sceptic  
-because of the infinite complexity, beucase of combinatorial explosion, we have to use heuristics  
-because of this, we are always going to be biased  
-BUT that way of doing things is not only necessary (_ala_ JV's catch phrase), but its ALSO fucking incredible  
-this reasonable way of doing things, of relying on heuristics, does an amazing job most of the time  
-we only think its not that good and that we should be relying on rationality (which connects to DC's point about reasonableness - not entirely able to explicate this link yet, but would like to) because we see where rationality works well  
-what we're not seeing there is that this is a tiny tiny subset of what we do  
-for every moment that your applying rationality to a hard and complex problem, there are many millions if not billions of moment where you are getting by completely fine navigating a sea of almost infinite complexity, **and you do it so well that you don't even notice** (this is JV's point - that every step of just picking up a cup is combinatorially explosive, and you manage to navigate that so well you don't even notice how good you are)
 
-so much of what we do, we are actually incredible at, when we really stop to think about it, but we just go through our lives doing it  
-we should actually be VENERATING reasonable-ness
   

-directly ties to JV's "the very things that make you adaptively intelligent…"  
-you are INCREDIBLY adaptively intelligent  
-so much so that we are only just starting to work out how to get robots to move
 
-BUT THEN THE OTHER SIDE  
-"also make you prone to self-deception"  
-the price you pay for your adaptively intelligent ability to use heuristics to realise relevance
 
-this is the trifecta  
-point at top - universe is infinitely complex  
-bottom left corner of pyramid - you are miraculously, incredibly adaptively intelligent  
-bottom right corner of pyramid - those same things also make you self-destructive, self-deceptive, perenially prone to biases - which then leads to so many of our problems. This is part of what it is to be human, it cannot be any other way
 
-this pyramid is the start, can work out from there
 
-from there - ethical outcomes of this, not quite sure where it goes from there to dynamic process stuff, and tension between opposites stuff  
-I feel there's a strong link there, but im not quite sure what it is yet
