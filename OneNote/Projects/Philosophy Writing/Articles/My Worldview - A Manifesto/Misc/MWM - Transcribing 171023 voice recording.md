-AFTMC episode 27, about 22-ish minutes in
 
-shows why we will perennially succumb to biases, because they're an outcome of our necessary ability to use heuristics to deal with combinatorial explosion and the enormous complexity of the world￼  
-so in order to function and deal with the world, we essentially need to be biased￼  
-this means that all the things that frustrate the fuck out of me with people are unavoidable to some extent. They are going to happen and going to keep happening, because that's an unavoidable part of being a functioning human being
 
-but we should still all be striving to get better at overcoming the self-deception that is functionally necessary for & endemic to our existence
 
-So I should cut people a bit more slack
 
-I actually used to recognise this is more, this necessity, & was more understanding of people and their foibles. This has been overtaken recently by frustration at people, at their inability to see more than 1 side of things and succumb to biases  
-this has kind of happened since meeting Holly - I think her particular biases, and because I was so close to her, really frustrated me
 
-ultimately, life is hard to balance and navigate
    
WORLDVIEW STUFF:  
-existence is almost infinitely complex
 
-it is, and always will be, incredibly difficult for everybody, no matter who they are and where they're at. The mere fact that they're finite humans living in this incredibly complex and difficult existence ensures it
 
-the things that lead to this proposition  
-the infinite complexity  
-the fact that certainty is impossible￼-that everything is more complex than it seems￼-everything John Vervaeke is talking about in these early episodes to do with combinatorial explosion  
-all of this should lead to empathy and charity and understanding for other people, because things are always harder than we think they are.  
-when we are becoming polarised, or are unable to see outside our own small viewpoint, or ALL the other things in this vein that have been annoying the fuck out of me about people lately, we do these things BECAUSE of these unavoidable biases
 
-and that then supports (?) the Nietzschean & processual (and Heraclitan) view of the world as a constant state of adaptation to a constant flux  
-and supports that claim that existence is caught in a constant state of tension between opposites (although it's probably more complicated than that - as in, not a binary pole)
 
-And that means things are constantly dynamic and changing and shifting and so there is no end state. There's no certainty. There's no rule we can apply to always get us what we need (i.e. like _p_ values have been treated)  
-It's just about constantly trying to do the best we can to adapt and transcend (which is itself a process of adaptation)
 
~~-it's interesting how my feelings around kindness towards people predated discovering this stuff (I've always had a sense that we should act in this way, and I've always valued kindness) but it's just been further enhanced by my studies in psychology and looking into this stuff~~
 
~~-this is the first step in learning to express myself and starting to do philosophy. It's diving into the depths of my worldview and exploring where it comes from and what's driving it.~~  
~~-And then explicating each of those parts, building on them, making them really clear~~  
~~-and then building on the evidence for those so that I can explain it to somebody else.~~  
~~-essentially a manifesto of my way of seeing the world.~~
 
~~-remember that from around the second half of episode 26 of AFTMC up to an episode somewhere in the thirties, are fucking vitally important~~  
~~-and also that episode that you wrote a journal entry about where JV talks about his idea that to be an autopoietic thing is to be a self-transcending thing~~  
~~-because this ^^^ then aligns with your feelings, ideas & worldview - ie that existence is a process of constant adaptation and just trying to do the best~~  
~~-this brings all of that together.~~
 
-And from there you can expand out into talking about certainty and why you think certainty is impossible. ￼-And then you can pull in everything that's related to that, like:  
-the quest for certainty that David Chapman talks about  
-the replication crisis and the problems that leads to (and all the other things I'm fucking interested in around that)  
-then THAT leads into the left hemisphere, right hemisphere stuff and what Ian McGilchrist talks about. ￼  
-You need to structurally lay out all of this & expand on it
 
-that's my first step because it then just blooms outwards from there.
 
-a second place to then go onto after this is to then dive into why it is I think that the world is infinitely complex, because that's a really central element in my whole worldview - ie it directly links to:  
-adaptation  
-self-transcendence  
-the tension between two polar opposites  
-principle of charity  
-the notion that life's hard  
-the notion that everything is more complex than we think
 
-I can dive lay out this whole argument - ie here's my argument for why the universe is infinitely complex.

-expand on why this is

-actually think about & list these out

-the adaptation is more like a view of the self

-how?
