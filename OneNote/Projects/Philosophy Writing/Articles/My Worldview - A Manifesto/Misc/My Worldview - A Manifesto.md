I firmly believe that things are always more complicated than we think they are.
 
And in fact, I am going to open this manifesto with a deliberately bold claim - I believe that the universe/reality/existence is infinitely complex, or at least so complex it may as well be infinite for our purposes.
 
I will use the term _unbounded complexity_ moving forward, though I am not entirely comfortable with it (I'm not even sure 'complexity' is the right term).
 
I am not trained in many of the fields from which I am going to draw evidence, and **I also believe strongly in the limits of human knowledge - including my own**. So there are any number of ways in which my formulation may be wrong, things I am unaware of, or am not seeing. And I would love for these to be illuminated if they're there.
 
There are whole fields of study and deeply researched areas of inquiry relating to this, such as computability theory, computational complexity theory, the class of undecidable problems _etc_. I know very little about these areas, and there are likely people who are vastly more informed in these areas who could muster a whole range of evidence and arguments against this.
 
But I believe that there is enough evidence for this argument that it is at least compelling, and should be considered.
 
I am going to list a number of examples. But there are many more beyond this; they go on, and on, and on. I could get bogged down in just outlining this single part of things, so instead I will choose an arbitrary number of examples of evidence to draw on to establish at least an initial argument. I hope this at least makes you begin to question.
 
And it starts with a travelling salesman and a game of chessâ€¦

-complexity implicit in the statement "things aren't black and white, there's many shades of grey"  
-this relates so closely to nebulosity
