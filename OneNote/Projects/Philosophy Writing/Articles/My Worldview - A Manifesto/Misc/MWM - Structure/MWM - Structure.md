-reality/existence/the world is infinitely (or almost infinitely) complex  
-explain why you think this is the case  
-e.g. combinatorial explosion as a manifestation of this
 
-in order to be able to operate in this near-infinitely complex world, we need to use heuristics. These are absolutely essential to us  
-but because of this need, we will constantly succumb to biases  
-i.e. "the very things that make you adaptively intelligent, also you make prone to self-deception and self-destruction"
 
-because of this, life is really fucking hard, for everyone, and always will be. Therefore, we should adopt an attitude of charity towards others, and always strive to be empathetic and understanding of other's flaws
 
-but we should also still be constantly striving to overcome our own biases and limitations - which is a process of self-transcendence

-PYRAMID STRUCTURE
 
-Reality is unboundedly complex

-you are near-miraculous  
-you are incredibly adaptively intelligent  
-you somehow intelligently focus in on the just￼ the things that are most relevant to you in an￼ enormously complex environment￼-you do this by using heuristics

-because of this, you are also perennially prone to biases and self-deception  
-because the heuristics you need to use to navigate complexity also force you to pre-judge what is relevant - and that doesn’t always work out for the best
