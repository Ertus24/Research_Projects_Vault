I just got out of my last or second last session with my therapist for the year. It was a really
good one. We kind of delved into that internalised desperate loneliness and the desire for touch
and emotional intimacy and struggles about being vulnerable in relationships and friendships
and stuff. The homework she gave me was one, was to try to open myself up a little bit
more in conversations. We talked about how often it feels like conversations do tend
to be a bit one-sided where I'm asking how are the people going and I'm hearing them
and listening to them and respecting them and then not really either they're not doing
the same back or when they do I don't know how to do anything with it or I dismiss it
or so she's basically like it's going to make you uncomfortable but try to you know like
find maybe like sometimes in conversations find moments to if things if you're talking
about saying and things drift away from what you were talking about find ways to bring
it back to what you were talking about so that you can you know be vulnerable with other
people so you can open up a little bit to other people and notice how you feel notice
how it makes you feel. The other and the other thing was which I think is the because that's
something I'm already like that's absolutely definitely it's something I'm already trying
to do a little bit but I've kind of got to go ahead to really focus on it and a bit more
like parameters around it but she also said I think this is a more interesting one try
and find ways to get touch outside of relationships because if you are if you're feeling desperate
for touch you can get that outside of it like you can get that outside of relationship but
also if the only way you know how to get that is in a relationship you're going to try
and you're going to throw yourself into a relationship to try and get that trying to explore safe
ways to get physical touch and know that it will make you uncomfortable. She suggested
massage and she suggested the big one dancing and that I think is a really I think that's
that's the thing I think I probably I think I need to take dancing classes because I am
deeply deeply uncomfortable with dancing. I'm deeply uncomfortable with you know displaying
and moving my body in public to really be in like in my body in public I feel uncomfortable
in my body and I'm also I'm deeply uncomfortable with touching other people and being touched
in a public setting. So I think it is the it is the perfect thing for me to do because
it is a it is a it is a thing that makes me uncomfortable that is that is like the perfect
way to to it's the perfect thing to challenge and also because you know at the end like
the outcome of that is also going to be at over time I will become I will become more
comfortable with physical touch in the puppet I will become more comfortable with my body
I will come to more comfortable with dancing I may start to enjoy dancing because there
is definitely elements of me that do enjoy dancing you know I enjoy when nobody's watching
I enjoy rocking out to music. I just get very self-conscious so I think and it will give
me some touch so I think she's fucking bang on there I think I need to explore dancing
classes.
