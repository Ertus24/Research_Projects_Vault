I don't want to be the way I am.
I'm sick of feeling...
bad about how I feel.
I'm sick of feeling how I feel.
I'm sick of feeling like, "Oh, I'm moving on."
I'm not thinking about Holly all that much, and I want to avoid us.
Talking about us.
I want to be left to my own devices.
And then feeling bad about that. And then finding actually... Nope, it's all still there.
I'm still desperately fucking sad.
*sigh*
I just don't want to be like this anymore.
