6.50am on Tuesday? Is it Tuesday today? Wednesday. Wednesday the 12th of July. It's not a SEVA.
This is not a SEVA, this is just some stuff I want to get down, some things I need to
think about and I need to get down that I need to think about kind of thing.
Yeah, I'm just thinking, I was just thinking about it last night and for some
reason I'm having a really negative judgment. I'm having a strong
reaction to
poly and the... I'm finding I'm having a lot of doubts. I don't know how to say it,
how to phrase it, what exactly is... I kind of know what's happening or how
I've been feeling. Look, to simplify it, to use language that I can fucking come up with
without having to do the dance, I've been having a strong negative reaction to
poly kind of after our meeting the other day. Not like anger, but I've been finding
my... it's like, it feels like... and it's kind of... I guess it's the... how I'm
feeling now is kind of an odds with how I was feeling while we were meeting up.
Because while we were meeting up it was really nice, it was really lovely and we
talked about a bunch of things in a very calm and kind and careful way and Holly
said some things that were really validating and lovely and you know she
said some things that at the time made me feel like, oh yeah actually like she did
kind of address some of my concerns I guess about us trying again. You know it's
like how is... how is...
how is us getting back together going to work while you're on
Centrelink? And she was like, after a few things, she was like you know, I think we
kind of talked about it and I came to the realization like yeah we we can just
like date sort of thing while she's on it and we'd be boyfriend girlfriend just
don't live together. Although she did kind of talk about you know we can't we
would just have to you know not talk. Sounds like in some ways what she was
saying it sounds like we'd still kind of have to keep it a bit secret a little
bit which I don't want to do and I want to be in a fucking secret relationship.
So yeah but so not entirely convinced but that assuage some of the worries that
you know we could be together and she could get her money basically.
And she talked about how she was living with Dan for like a year and they were
fucking and she was still getting her money. They just didn't realize.
That's stepping on bounds of...
Anyway...
[Train sounds]
Yeah which talking about it now makes me raise some kind of ethical concerns I
think for me and ethical concerns with Holly's way of approaching things but
anyway yeah I...
Yeah it was that and then she validated that I had been doing a
lot of emotional work and that she wasn't really prepared for my problems
with the emotional work of our relationship and that I was carrying a
lot of emotional burden which was incredibly validating and was like
that's her not recognizing that and blaming me for things was like the
source of a lot of my hurt.
But and I felt like that felt like incredible like I was like broken to
tears when she told me that but now after the fact...
Jesus Christ David, calm the fuck down.
It was like at the rear end me.
Yeah after that like it's I felt incredibly validated and heard and seen
and good when she did when she said that but now after the fact it's like that
kind of hasn't stuck and I'm still feeling some of that hurt like she kind
of addressed those hurts a bit but now I'm it's like I it's like it was really
powerful in the moment but afterwards I can remember I kind of I can remember it
but it's like the emotional impact of of that has just like faded completely and
I'm still feeling all the hurt a bunch.
Yeah and the end of the night was I don't know like uncomfortable it's like my
feelings just kind of switched around and I went from having a really good
time and really wanting to see her to be like suddenly being like right I want I
want to get the fuck out of here kind of thing and just being really like I'm
overwhelmed and you know that sitting in the car and being unable to say anything
for like a solid fucking ten minutes.
Yeah.
And it feels like for some reason the end of the night left more of an
impression than I don't know it's like I've been dwelling on the negatives like
I've been dwelling on since then I've been dwelling on you know the fact that
I could I could smell her breath from the other side of the car and it grossed
me out and that like a merely brought back that that whole side of things and
us talking here we talked about money the money side of things and jobs and
all that kind of stuff and she's in the same position she was in before was
thinking about it the same way she was before and I'm like I don't just I don't
know if that works for me.
Oh fat old dog.
Yeah.
So.
Yeah I've just I've just been having a lot of I've been feeling a lot of
negative things in some ways negative like dwelling on the on the
parts where we don't work and dwelling on kind of my pain and hurt and stuff
despite the fact that the vast majority of the night was really lovely and you
know we really reconnected and she kind of addressed a few of my hurts and
and worries and stuff so I kind of want to I kind of want to work out like I
don't kind of want I think I kind of need to well I don't actually I don't
need to at all but I want to work out where why it is that I'm like what I
what actually it is that I'm dwelling on why I'm dwelling on it and what what's
that's kind of what that's kind of telling me I guess what are my feelings
telling me that I'm that I need to pay attention to like is it telling me that
the negatives about our relationship outweighing the outweigh the positives
for me like because it's and I'm trying to keep vacillating back and forth
between I really like I'd want it I kind of want to get back together and go down
and see her and I'm thinking about you know like when I think about all the
gorgeous cute wonderful times we had together you know like sitting on the
couch reading or her being just fucking so fucking cute it's not fair or you
know and trying to think about the gift that she got me and how she talked about
you know that part of reason she fell in love with me was that I'm I'm a creative
person and all these things my heart swells and I'm like oh I miss you so
much and I do love you so much you know and thinking about things that she said
since we broke up that broke my heart like her saying and when I go to the UK
that she's scared she'll never be able to find me again
that kind of makes me want to cry right now that attachment that we still have
but then I vacillate back to the other side of things of like dwelling on the
the problems with our relationship it's like ah what do I do
really that's probably telling me that there was positives and negatives and
I've tried and my problem I'm trying to process them and it's difficult
basically that's probably what's what this is telling me and what's happening
on one street back damn it yeah so I think I just and I realized after all
after that night I realized I am in the right place right now I haven't really
been feeling like it but what I'm doing right now where I am that's where I'm
exactly where I need to be I need to be where I am right now I need to be
doing what I'm doing I need to take the next couple of months take it a little
bit easy on work and really do some mental health work and some mental work
and and and get some therapy and really process my emotions and learn from this
experience otherwise I'm not gonna be able to move move forward I feel stuck
it's kind of because I am I'm still I'm still stuck emotionally and kind of and
that's okay I'm in it I'm in a as long as I don't sit on it and do and as long
as I don't act on it and I don't do anything about it or don't do anything
with it and just try and suppress it and move on with my life and as long as I
don't just sit around at home and do nothing and blow all my money like I need
to still be working a bit and man save my needs still need to use this I don't
means if I'm not working full-time I won't be saving a huge amount of money
like a massive amount of money which is like what I kind of wanted to do but I
think this takes priority and as long as I can make enough that I can live and
still save a bit of money and take advantage of the fact that I'm living at
home that's okay and I'm I am doing I am where I need to be I'm doing what I need
to be doing it then it's that doesn't even if it doesn't feel good that doesn't
mean I need to run off somewhere else and try and go find a different
situation and be in a different place in a different situation to make myself
feel better it's going to feel bad I've had a break
like a breakup things are really still really messy and confusing I'm messy and
confused I have a lot of work to do on myself a lot of processing to do a lot
of growth to do and that's gonna be shit it's like it's going to hurt it's going
to be confusing I'm going to be like everything's pointless and shit I hate
it all
I'm in the best position to do that at the moment so I need to take
that opportunity and not try and run away to something else
Wow so yeah and also it's like I don't have to have an answer for Holly as long
as I can do what I was talking about yesterday and be open with her and give
her the information she needs to make the decision she would need will need
to make and not string her along I don't have to have have any decisions like
that's okay the position I'm in is okay I don't I'm in the right place doing
the right thing I don't have to rush anything no it
feels like I have to I don't I have to rush anything for Holly I don't have to
make any decisions for Holly I have to make any I just have to do what I'm
doing so just keep doing what I'm doing basically
and except that it's still gonna feel shit basically but yeah I want to I want
to work out why I do want to process and work out what's happening with my
feelings around Holly and why I'm kind of dwelling on the negatives after such
a good night and what that's telling me and what it is that I'm dwelling on and
what that's telling me
