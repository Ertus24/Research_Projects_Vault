When people are denied the right to, this is from Philosophize This episode 173 on Simone
Veigh, The Need for Roots. And at 21 minutes and 36 seconds in he says, he says that when,
Simone Veigh says that when people are denied their ability to participate in their culture,
i.e. they are uprooted, they are dehumanised. Part of what it is that makes them human is
taken away. Human rights are not the answer to the problems of capitalism, among other
things, but the modern world we live in is soul draining and it defeats our ability to,
it dehumanises us and it defeats our ability to rise up, to rebel, to rev-lute, revolt.
After seeing the problem, he says that after seeing the problem first hand, Simone Veigh
realised that revolution was the new opium of the masses because it's, i'm guessing,
it's like a false hope. It's like a thing that is used to string people along and give
them some hope that things could be different, or you know, a way to deal with the soul numbing
fucking, i don't know, soul numbing-ness, soul numbing existential dread and meaninglessness
and pointlessness and vacuum of their life by giving them this thing that they can pretend
to fight for, which won't actually make a difference. Things that people will fight
and die for, but that very rarely results in changes and when they do it's usually superficial.
For Simone Veigh, the answer isn't a political revolution, it's a new way of thinking about
ethics.
