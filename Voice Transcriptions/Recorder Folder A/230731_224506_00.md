I miss Holly so much right now.
I'm finding myself constantly thinking of her
and starting to think about whether maybe she actually was right.
That there was more we could have done, more we should try to make it work.
It's part of me that's thinking of just running down to Melbourne to be with her, to see her.
There's a big part of me that's worried that that's just me getting emotional
and it feels like all the things I was hurt by and that I was worried about
and felt like we weren't working, they suddenly seem less important
and I'm a bit worried about that.
Maybe I was hyper-focusing on them before, maybe, I don't know.
They just seem less important now.
I've signed up, I've gotten onto Bob Wall and signed up to adult friend finder
and I'm looking through all those things and part of me is pretty, like, wants to have sex with other people
but there's a part of me that just wants my Holly back.
I want my Holly back.
