It's 11 o'clock at night on, I can't remember the date, Sunday, the day after Holly called.
And I desperately want her presence.
I can almost feel her in the bed next to me. I can almost hear her voice.
See her tucked up in the sheets.
I miss her so badly right now.
I wish so much she was here.
There's a part of me deep down that's almost not conscious but occasionally I just catch glimpses of it.
It feels like I'm the reason we couldn't make it work.
I feel so ashamed for that.
I feel like there's something wrong with me.
Why couldn't I just let her do what she needed to do to get to the point she needed to get to, work through PTSD and find a job at her own pace?
Why couldn't I just be with her? I always feel like I needed to be away from her and push her away.
