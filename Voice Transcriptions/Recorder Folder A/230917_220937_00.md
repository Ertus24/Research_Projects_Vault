It kind of feels like my whole life is on hold at the moment.
Waiting for the moment that I make, waiting for me to make a decision about whether I
want to be with Holly or not.
I just feel like everything is just waiting for that.
I'm just treading water while I work that out.
I don't feel like I can really move forward until I make that decision.
I feel stuck.
