I am... I think it's 10.30? 10.30am. I'm sitting in the living room chair next to the big window,
reading my book. I only just finished breakfast. I woke up at about 8ish and lay in bed until
about 9.30am on my phone on Tinder. Didn't enjoy it and I don't want to do that again.
I just want to stop being on my phone in the morning. But I'm noticing a feeling of needing
to... a feeling of... feeling like I need to race through... like get this... I'm trying
to just sit and enjoy my time. Enjoy reading my book. So I'm doing it. I'm sitting reading
my book. My Daring Greatly book. And I'm trying to... just sit and enjoy the day. Enjoy the
wind rustling the leaves and the sun shining on the leaves. Which I don't seem to notice
those things as much anymore. I think partly the busyness and anxiety and also the pills.
Yeah. I'm just trying to enjoy reading, sit and enjoy reading my book and have a nice slow
morning. And I'm noticing a feeling of anxiety and a feeling of needing to rush through and
read the book as quickly as possible and get on to the next thing. Whatever the next thing
is. I've got all these other ideas busting around in my head as to things I should be
doing. I'm feeling a bit sick in my stomach. I'm feeling the stress ball in my chest. I'm
feeling very tired and lethargic. My eyes are heavy and sore. I'm not feeling peaceful,
which I think is what I'm looking for.
