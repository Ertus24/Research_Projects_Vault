I've just started reading a book by Clementine Ford called "This is How We Love"
Something like that. "How We Love"
Which has proven to be extremely good
Really quite heart rending and heartfelt
And doesn't feel like a lot of the stuff that I've interacted with
Quite lovely
She's talking about her mum's death
And some other things
And it's that and a few other things that are making me realise that
She's talking about her relationship with her mother, I think
And all of that is making me realise that I need space from my family
Just like Holly does, not for the same reasons and not in quite the same way
But I still... I need to live my own life
I need to...
I need to live my own life
I need to move beyond them
I need to move out from under their shadow and their influence
I need to get on with my life
I need to... I need distance from them and to forge my own life
And every time I've done that it's been truncated
Like I did that when I was living in Korea
I had that when I was living in Korea
And it came to an end and I came home
I had it for a little bit when I was living with Jaden
Although it didn't feel quite the same
And then I came home
I had it quite strongly when I was living with Holly
And then it came to an end
And it's okay, I've needed it
But I think I need to move on with my life a bit
I need to live my own life
Which might mean accepting that I either have to work hard
Or I need to calm down on some of my financial goals
And release some of the pressure I put on myself to make money and have a job and all those kinds of things
And be able to save a lot and build up for things
Something's got to give
And I think it might have to be living with... it might have to be my family
I think I need to build my own life
Not just yet, it doesn't have to happen right now
But this is the time in my life I think when it's just naturally going to start happening
I'm tired of being around them all the time
I want to gain distance from them so I can love them more, if that makes sense
Like, I'm not a child anymore
And I need to move beyond that
And I can love them better, and know them better
When I'm not under their roof, under their shadow, under their influence
When I'm my own person
And I can love them from my own person, if that makes sense
Rather than as their child
That's the stage of life I'm now entering
And it's scary
But it's kind of exciting at the same time
So I guess that means
Probably doing this job four days a week and sticking with it
And sticking to doing it four days a week
It's good
It's doable, I might be able to take it elsewhere
Like I might be able to move to Melbourne with it
I don't know
I think it's worth just doing that for a while
It's not worth diving back into uni just yet
I don't know what I'm doing with myself
I don't know what I want to do
And it's not worth just doing that to do something
Just keep working this
Even if you move out
That's fine
Just keep doing this
