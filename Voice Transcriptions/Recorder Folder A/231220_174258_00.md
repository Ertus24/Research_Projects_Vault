Holly, you deserve a life and a relationship where you are happy, safe and supported.
And I will always, constantly be terrified that I am not strong enough to give you that.
Because I feel like I've shown again and again that I wasn't strong enough to be able to
support you.
I tried my hardest and I fell apart.
I don't think I can be what you need.
I love you.
