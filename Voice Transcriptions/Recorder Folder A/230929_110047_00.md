So I think I'm realizing that the hard part of, well not that, there's a lot of hard parts, but
I think the thing I'm really struggling with, with to do with Holly at the moment is that
If we're not going to be together
Being in contact or like, you know, like I'm not moving on at the moment at all basically
I'm still wrapped up in our relationship
I'm thinking about us. I'm
I'm thinking about us through about the future in terms of us. I am taking us into considerate like I'm
And Holly into consideration
I'm not moving on at all. I'm stuck in this limbo state and it's painful and hard
And I don't know if I can keep doing it as much as I don't want that to be the case
I love Holly and she's really important to me and I do want to be friends with her, but I don't know if I can at the moment
I don't know if I can
be friends with her
And still move like I'm not sure I can move on and still be friends with her
Like I don't know if I can move on while I am being friends while we are friends basically
And it just doesn't it doesn't really feel like we are friends. It feels like we are ex lovers who still love each other
And aren't together and that's painful and I can't I can't move on I can't think about spending time with anybody
I can't think about being with anybody else. I can't make plans for the future
Beyond maybe being with Holly. I can't I'm stuck at the moment and I it's not a nice place to be
So I'm kind of caught in between I
Said to her that I want I know that I wanted to I knew that I wanted to be friends and I do
you know and
We both said multiple times throughout the period of us breaking up that
No matter what happened we wanted to stay friends and that I want that but I don't know if I can do that
And I don't you know
I've not been able to be able to accept that I've not been able to accept the idea of
And the pain of the idea of just moving on because that means
You know if we were if I would do moving on that means completely moving on it means
Giving up any any hope of being together
Giving it and not thinking of like giving up because I'm still holding even if I'm trying not to and I'm not trying to plan
I'm trying to not playing around it. I'm still holding on to that and I can't let go I can't let go of that
And it means
Completely cutting contact not you know, no good reads nothing blocking each other on everything
I need to get rid of everything that's a reminder of her and put them in a box somewhere
She needs to do the same and we need to move on with our lives. We both need to do that and just say look
No, that is the answer for the future for the future. No
That's that's the answer no
And just accept that and even though there's it there's so much of me that doesn't want that to be the case and I'm this
So much of me that's gonna be being like well, I maybe eventually we can just know
But getting to that point is so painful and scary and hard
But at the same time, you know
There is a lot of thing reasons I can see that to get back together
It's like maybe she's right
Maybe you know I've been feeling more and more like maybe we should be getting back
We should get back together and try again, but it's like I don't know if we should do that
Without really fucking thinking about it and it's taking me a lot of time to process everything and think about it
I don't know if it's I don't know how long it would take to me to get to a point where I'm really not sure but like
a lot more sure like
You know
This this so much I have to process and there's so much I have to think about and I
Feel like she's either like hasn't been doing that or is just has thought about it and it has made the decision for it to be
Okay, and I'm I haven't and I don't know how long it's going to take and it's hurting both of us to be in this state
of me trying to think through those things and
Hold out on for some possibility
It's like I'm stuck between
Putting more time into thinking about it, which I feel like I have to do
Otherwise, I'm just gonna you know
We might get back together and it doesn't work because of all these reasons that I've yet to really process
And what I just you know, it's not fair and either of us and I just end we both just end up getting hurt again
Stuck between that wanting to just get back together
To get around that but also just cuz I miss her and I love her and I want to have a focus for the future
And I love her and I miss her
Probably the biggest reasons
And
Not it not being
Not being okay in this in-between state of like we haven't decided not to be together
We haven't decided to be together and I feel like we can't but like I'm not sure if we can
Decide yet or I could decide yet until I've done some of those that thinking but I don't know how long that's gonna take
So it's like we we're still stuck in this limbo state until I do that
But I don't know how that looks longer that long long that's gonna take so it's like do I do we just stay in this limbo?
State that's kind of hurting both of us. Do we just give up and move on and actually try and move on which means
completely cut in contact
Not like giving up entirely on moving on being together at all and moving on with our lives and being with other people and things
Like that, you know got moving to the UK whatever
And
What do we
Get back together without having thought about all of these things are potentially hurting to like get hurt
And you know, it's and it's unfair. It's like
And then the project all of those prospects none of those prospects are all that good
And I'm stuck and I feel stuck and trapped and the idea I think the most painful thing is the idea of
Completely moving on and just giving up hope entirely that is so fucking painful
But I don't know if I can keep doing being in this limbo state
So then the answer is to not like the different but I mean the limbo state it's either get back together or move completely on
because
The choices are completely completely cut contact completely move on get back together or staying in this limbo state and
All of those kind of suck
Like
I will there's a lot of me that wants to get back together, but I am there's I'm so unsure of whether we can make it work
Because there's all the stuff I need to think about there's all the shame I need to deal with there's all this
You know feeling of inadequacy and feeling like I can't deal with our problems that I need to that I need to deal with
And that might take a while that might take a long while
And I you know I feel like you know kind of beholden to the fact that I said I want to remain friends and now
Now it feels like terrible and like I'm going back in my word to say that actually no, I don't know if I can do that
But maybe that's what we both need
You know I wanted to be more sure across all of these things be more sure of all of these things before I talk to
You again, then we ended up talking
You know bushes, and I was and I can't you know I'm struggling to
That's why I didn't needed the no contact because I was struggling to process these things while I
But then I haven't been able to move on
We've not been in contact, but I've still been thinking about you all the fucking time. I've been I've been
Edging towards thinking about getting back together and moving down to Melbourne to be with you
Just and you know and I I wanted to I didn't want to confuse you wanted to be more sure of all of these things
And have done more of this work and process more of these things before I came down to to talk to you, but
No, maybe this is about I may be coming down to see you as a bad idea, but it's not locked in
I'm not locked in but I
Think at least I need to come down and talk to her about where we're at with
Where I'm out with the with the contact versus the no contact and the fact that I'm I feel trapped in a limbo state
And I'm finding it very uncomfortable
And being going no contact was a heart was was caught, but it was also kind of what I needed, but also
You know I kind of maybe want to talk to you about what?
What being together might look like and how I'm feeling about that now because that has changed a bit
But I haven't made a decision, and I don't know if we should make a decision yet
And I didn't want to hurt you
And I didn't want to confuse you and I wanted to know more about being more sure and know more about this before
We talked and then now we've ended up talking again
It's just fucking don't know what to do I feel so trapped
And this is probably what I'm going to talk to my therapist about in nine minutes
Because I'm on the way to see them at the moment
The fact that I feel trapped that these are the three options I can see none of them feel good
And that I wanted to be more more sure which option I wanted to go with before I went to talk to her and now
I'm going to talk to her
And I want it man. I'm not quite sure now. I'm not quite sure why I'm doing that. It's like
because
We need to buy I think we both need to understand where what maybe we just both need to understand where we're at
And I need to be upfront about the fact that I'm struggling with the limbo state. We're in
And also talk to her about my feelings about maybe like you know that I am considering getting back together more like I am
Maybe you were right and maybe there is more things we can try
But I don't know if I can make it work and I want to I wanted to work
I want this to be and I want to and I want to do it
I want to just dive back in but I don't know if I can I don't know if I can
Hack it basically and that's something I have to deal with and I don't know how long it's going to take to deal with
And I don't know if we should try to try again until I've
Done that process I think but in the brain is like in doing that processing
I feel and I think we maybe don't both do feel stuck in this limbo state
So what do we fucking do?
because
Being the being in contact while not being together, but I'm not still not really being friends because we're not moving on is also
Like its own kettle of fish. It's it's it's you know painful in its own way, and it's still still it still feels stuck in a limbo state
Yeah, it's like it. Maybe makes it a little bit harder to process things. I'm not sure
But it's like hard to not be in contact
It's like
I'm losing my train of thought it's hard to hold on to all of this
Because
Because
It is uncomfortable. We're not friends. We're not love. We're not together
We're ex lovers who are still in love, but at least I'm still in love with you
So it's this constant like enforced distance. That's really painful and awkward and uncomfortable and
all I want to do is hold you in my arms and kiss you and call you my love and
Do things the way we used to do them and I can't and that that enforced distance is so painful
Which means it's also not a friendship because I don't feel like that with my friends
I'm comfortable with my friends, and I'm not this is not comfortable
This is stilted and awkward and painful
And it's still nice. It's still lovely to see you because I love you and I want to see you
But it's not a friendship, and it's not together. It is this weird limbo awkward in-between state that hurts
Although it doesn't hurt as much as it did to be fair
But it's I don't know if I can do it
Which is why I was doing the no contact, but the no contact is it still what I still a limbo state because I can't move on
Maybe what we need to do is both just by the like like the bullet on either end is like right fuck it
We're getting back together
And we're just going to try and make it work and regardless of whether we know we can't whether if we can or not
We'll just try again and see how all again. We'll try dating and see how that goes or
We fight the bullet say this is hurting both of us holding on like this is hurting both of us it might work
But getting to that point is painful
So let's just move on let's just give up and move on with our lives and give up and give up on the idea
of doing it and move on
Because I don't think I can I don't think I can be friends what I wish I could
And I still want to be yet, I still wish we could and I still there's a part of me
There's a very big part of it
I hope we can find our way back to each other and reconnect at some point
But that's probably going to be years
like maybe in years time or run back into each other if it's meant to be it's meant to be and we'll run back into
each other or
One of us will have moved on enough
I've moved on enough and one of us one of us will reach out to the other in like
45 years time kind of thing and try and reconnect and be friends or maybe we'll have just completely moved on
But this limbo state we're in is just awful for both of us. I
Need I think I need to talk to her about that I need to go down and talk to her and say look
This is where I'm at. This is the state I'm in. I don't know where are you? How do you feel?
This is kind of the three options. I'm seeing
Staying in this limbo state cutting contact moving on or getting back together and none of them feel all that good right now
Because I'm not moving on I'm so I am stuck I have not I've not moved on I
Think about you all the time. You know, I thought I was excited to explore being with other people
I can't I cannot do it. I feel like I'm betraying you and that's not going to go away while we're in the tool
But decision is made
Thinking I'm thinking about being with people and all I really want is to be with you I want to have sex with you I know
And that is still something that's still a part of me. That's still part of me
I'm gonna have to and that's also what I want to deal you know, some of you know, we both
If we were to get back together what it would look like and what we know what we would need to do first
What we would both need to understand the my concerns about it that I'm you know, I
Real I do I do want to but these are my concerns and why I'm feeling like maybe it's not a good idea
Why it wouldn't work why I need to do more work before we could make it work. But yeah
This has been really helpful
I
Know maybe I need to talk to my therapist I'd like to talk to my therapist about this
But I don't know if it's really the kind of thing I should talk to my therapist about or a friend and help me sort
Through some of this stuff. I don't know
I'm not really sure whether to talk about the shame stuff or to talk about this or
Not quite sure what I want
But this has been really good
This has been really clarifying for me
Thinking it talking through this has let help me clarify and think through it myself
You
