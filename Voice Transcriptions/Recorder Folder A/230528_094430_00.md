is
nine forty three a m
on sunday the
twenty seventh
create
the eight of may
three days left
uh...
just a quick little one
something i just recognized or kind of start recognizing yesterday but
boundaries with friends
i'd just recognize that i have spent on quite a lot of my life
actually trying to establish boundaries with my friends around going to bed
at the time i go to bed
used to happen all the time
with the boys playing games
it happens when i go to see josh and sarah
i'll point by establish uh... like even if i don't voice it i say you know i
have a thing in my head of like right
this is the time i'm going to leave this is the time i'm going to go to bed
and
they would put pressure on me
like when i was playing games the boys literally all of them
like crack the shits at me and be like oh you know
you don't look like you have anything to do you've got fucking no job
fucking sleep until whatever
like it would be pretty much the entire
group of boys like jayden would do it all would do it hope you would do it all at
the same fucking time
it was just pretty hard to resist when your entire friend group
apply social pressure to you
i would give in as pretty much every fucking time or if i didn't give in
like usually i've given and then also get angry
but sometimes a lot of tonight
giving because i also want to stay up on the games
white parties to get so i would get so angry about it
i would get really fucking frustrated with them
it's like the air to not
fucking listening to me what i want what i need at all
assuming that because i don't have a job my time doesn't matter as much as there
is a confacants that whatever i want
and just because they are choosing to
be fucking me and children and stay up to two o'clock in the morning and then
have to go to work the next day
doesn't mean i have to do the same thing i would like to have a
pleasant life where i'm not fucking tired all the time
that was kind of like the the culture of our of our friend group
was staff played play games
and they would push me to do that and i had clear boundaries around that
often
even voiced with them and they would push me past that they would just ignore
those boundaries and
could juggling into not doing them and tom but justin series frinker kyle does
the same thing
last night they were all like
all bands could get it come get this could get a good get to sleep in the
nearly list of minutes away
look you might all be fucking young
by really prize my sleep
sleep is important to me and it's not going to try to maintain i'm trying to
get good sleep because it's like a struggle with it takes me a long time
to fall asleep
and annoyed me last night to it always does
and often given
i gave him last night i was
i didn't have a clear boundary around when i was going to leave
in my head
i had a
uh...
kind of like a waffley who won't leave it like nine up early that may be like
nine ten ish and i don't think the level
but i was checking my phone phone from like ten o'clock on with the black rock
i should probably leave and they're just not doing anything about it because
i felt that social pressure
i don't see i was ready to leave by that point it wasn't
so wasn't how to do it was hating my time
like i could have easily left i wasn't like super super enjoying
i was like a waiting for the game to finish
desperate like when the game finishes i think i was
but by
which is a sign that i should have just fucking left
and not given into social pressure so a lot of my friend like i said a lot of my
lot dot my life having my boundaries
bushed
body
my friends like most of my friend groups do that to me
and i'm kind of fucking tired of it
and i think it's maybe time to start recognize this now i think it's maybe
time to start standing up that boundary just being setting up a little like a
look
uh... i'm gonna leave
uh... x time
that these are reasons why
i think it's very reasonable i'm really next time
i want to work with our preferred you don't try to pressure me to not doing
that
because it frustrates me
uh... but
i'm
gala you that this time
what no matter what's happening basically does not know about what's
happening
that's fine i would very much like to leave at that time because i'm trying to
get to pick up a good amount of sleep and maintain some kind of sleep schedule
and i keep
giving into that
to social pressure i don't want to do that anymore
and if you keep
pushing me to not doing that i'll hang out with you less
basically
uh...
