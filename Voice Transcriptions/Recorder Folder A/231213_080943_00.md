So it's been a while since I've done one of these
These kind of voice journals
About feelings
But I think this is maybe something I need to think about and work through
I'm really fucking sick of living with that
I'm sick of living with my parents in general, but I
Think it's particularly dad. I'm just really tired of being around them all the time
Maybe I should approach this as a seaver. So what happened this morning?
Got up and got ready that didn't seem to be there
And as I was leaving
He kind of just came and stood at the door and
talked to me while I was getting like so I kind of
go out and
leave my
lunch at the inside the door go out
Sit down
Sit down and
Sit down and
But the bench and put my shoes on
And he was kind of just standing there at the door
As
I was leaving basically I kind of sort of like he I saw him and he saw me at the other end of the house
And he had just stood there and looked at me and then
Said hello father
Had a quick chat and then said goodbye and then I've been going about his business
Yes, I stepped outside. He just kind of stood at the door and talked to me the whole time. I was there
about I don't think about the
About what I'm what I'm doing like what time I'm starting and all that kind of stuff
And then talking about the grass at the front or something
And
I
Then as I kind of like fish pretty much shoes on and went to go
Sorry, I was like
it was like I can hang your thing out to you and
Your lunch out to you and lock the door if you just want to step out and go and I said no, that's okay
and then he kind of just kept stood it standing there and talking to me and then I
finished and then he opened the door and handed my
Despite me saying I didn't need him to do that. He opened the door and handed my lunch out to me
And then I closed the door and locked it and said goodbye and headed off
That was the situation
The emotion that I was feeling
Frustration
Something else I'm not quite sure what else it was frustration
As the primary emotion
Yeah, I'm not quite sure what else there's definitely more to it than just frustration but
Frustration was the primary thing I was feeling
The reflection on this I guess
It feels like
He's trying to reach out to me
And doesn't really know how the only way he knows how is to try and like do things for me
That I don't want him to do
I don't want him to fucking I don't want to talk to him all the fucking time
He seems to just like every time he sees me wants to engage in conversation
I want to fucking talk to him all the time. I don't want to talk to him all the time
I want to be around him all the time
and
he seems to be wanting to connect with me and the way he does it is by just talking to me about fucking nonsense and
Doing shit for me that I don't want him to do. I don't want him to
Like see me out in the morning. I don't want him to
I don't want him to
Fuck
God I'm tired. I don't want him to
I
Get I just get really fucking frustrated
When you know what specifically like he just he doesn't fucking know you just can't I can see where so many of my
fucking
Issues that came up in my relationship with Holly
Come from almost entirely from fucking dad. He cannot
He just has to
Can't fucking communicate about what he wants or needs he just has to like
You know like yesterday
He was he wanted to close
He wanted to close the
Windows
And rather than
Why am I finding this fucking exhausting to talk about
Well except tired
It's like it's done on the emotional energy to
Dive into these emotions that are pissing me off
he's pissing me off and I think the big thing is I feel like part of it of the way he's acting is coming from
his feelings around Jamie and
Wanting to you not wanting to have the same thing that happened
you know and fear about having the same thing happen with Jamie happen with me and
That's putting pressure on me. I
Can feel it with both of them and that's putting pressure on me to like
Be good and nice
Basically, you know so they
When I don't like at this stage in my life, I want fucking it's not that I hate them or anything
I just don't want anything to do with them mum a little bit
but I
Just I want I want to be living my in at this stage in life. I want to be living my own fucking life
I'm desperate to be living my own life
And I am I've hit a stage in my life where
I am recognizing all of the problems
My parents have that they've never done anything about and that they've influenced me with and now that I'm having to deal with
You know and I
Mean it's my choice to live with them, but it also doesn't I
Feel stuck because it feels like this in some ways in which I feel like the where I'm at in life right now
This is my only option and I also feel scared about moving on but at the same time
I also desperately want to move on and not live with them anymore
You know like I feel like I need this time
But I also so fucking desperately I feel like my life would be
I'd be making a lot more progress in things as well and feeling better about things if I wasn't living with them
And I'm tired of living under Jamie's shadow
I'm tired of
protecting with mum being their fucking parent like
I
Mum talks to me
The only person mum has to talk to me about her issues with dad and her fears and issues around Jamie is me I
Have to be the fucking parent
I'm fucking tired of that. I just want to live my life
And I'm tired of dealing with dad's but he debt 100% has OCD
Like he
He has like he told me the other day he has to walk around and check everything
You know because he's worried about what has Michael left open
And it keeps it like he literally said it keeps him up at night
He has OCD and he's never nobody has ever challenged him about that
Nobody's ever told him you probably have fucking OCD and he's never done anything about it
But it's impacted my life so fucking much it impacts my
relationship with him
constantly
And I'm tired like I understand so much how Holly felt not to the same extent
But you know when you have all of these fucking issues like when you want to be you want to escape from your parents
You want nothing to do with them, and you and you need to kind of work through some shit
That's directly to do with them
It makes it so much harder to do all those things when you're fucking living with them
for her it was like when she's even in the same fucking city as them, but
Yeah, this is complicated
I want to have a good relationship with them, but just it's particularly with dad
But to be honest at this point right now. I don't I actually don't really want to have that much of a relationship with dad at all
Kind of just want to fucking
Not speak to them either of them for the rest of my life
I don't want to have that much of a relationship with dad at all
I
kind of just want to fucking
Not speak to them either of them for a year
And I know that all of this stuff is like there's all of this
All of these problems. I'm having I could I should probably
the answer is to probably try to
Talk to them about some of them and work out some way to
Work out some way to compromise or
Make my needs known because this is exactly the stuff that I'm trying to learn how to do
Deal with conflict, but it's so hard to do that with your parents
It's all it's particularly hard to do that when you're fucking living with them
It just has I and it's interesting that while doing all of this I had while talking about all this I have this ball of
frustration and
Exhaustion in what soul deep exhaustion in my chest that's making it so fucking hard. It's what's making me keep going, uh
Which also enhances the fucking tiredness the physical tiredness quite a lot
This shit a fucking sick of my parents, I'm really fucking I'm not really that I don't really I wouldn't mind having
But if honestly, I think if I was living away from home, I'd be quite happy to take my mat to morning tea every
But once a month, I don't want to do the same thing a dad with that
I want to have basically no contact with that at all for a while
I
Don't want to talk to I don't want to have
Conversations with him because our conversations are utterly fucking meaningless. He doesn't know how to have any kind of a meaningful
emotional emotional conversation and
I feel like the pressure was on me because I kind of do know how to have those
But I don't know how to have them with dad. So I feel this internal pressure to do that with dad
But I don't know how to do that. I'm so uncomfortable in that doing that with dad
It's just
Yeah, I just want nothing to do with him at the moment
Maybe that would change a bit when I'm out of that but I'm not living with him
you know, I had a better closer relationship with them within when I was living with living at Oxley with Holly, but I
Just kind of I just want to live my own fucking life
I want to be out of their pocket and I want them to I want them to get the fuck out of my pocket
I
It's probably shit I need to talk to my therapist about I
Think
