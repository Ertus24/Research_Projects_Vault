I think part of why I cared so much and was kind of so frustrated with Holly about her
inability to, her spending habits and her inability to save ends, apart from feelings
of inequality and it kind of contributing to the feelings of inequality and a little
bit like being taken advantage of sometimes.
The biggest thing was that I feel trapped and it's also part of why I feel trapped
where I am now, where I desperately want to start investing.
Basically I'm desperate to try and find some way to not have to work so much because I
don't want to spend my life working and I also feel deeply incapable of keeping up with
working life and having a life and just in general keeping up with life while working.
I mean we'll keep up with life in general but particularly while working and it's like
the fire thing, the investing thing is the only way I can see out of that and I'm desperate
to escape so I really feel this enormous internal pressure to hit those goals, to work towards
that and also I've got conflicting other goals, exploring my interests and looking to things
I care about and all that kind of stuff.
I really want to be making money, not so I can have shit loads of money and buy all the
nice things, there's a few things I want to buy but it's mostly so I can invest and then
stop fucking working.
I care about that so much and I feel desperate to reach that goal in gaining that financial
stability I guess which is a value that our holy shares but she really struggles to put
into action.
Yeah, there's a lot more to this.
I've kind of finally just repeated the same thing multiple times and scratched the surface
but I think this is a big part, this feeling of being trapped in between, this feeling
of massive feeling of shame and inferiority I have around work and like overwhelm and
like I can't keep up with modern life, modern working life and my contempt for it and my
absolute refusal to spend my life working some full time job just to fucking get through
which is a thing that Holly can, it's hard because Holly and I have values that are pretty
similar in that regard, it's just at the same time I'm also like I need to know that I can
still go get, I know that I can still go just work a job even if it's only part time so
I can make a bit of money and keep myself going, I'll start to contribute to those goals
and I need to know that I can rely on Holly to do the same, that she can move beyond her
DSP because we can't reach any of those goals with her on her DSP.
I think also like feelings of like unfairness, you know when she was sitting around at home
all day not really doing all that much, dealing with her mental health mostly and being fucking
wounded, but she does sometimes lapse into getting stuck and just kind of sitting on
the couch even when she, you know that's probably a sign that her mental health isn't that good
but while I'm fucking grinding myself down trying to work, trying to study all of these
things I struggle a bit with that, I struggle a bit with that I think but the bigger thing
is I need to know that I can rely on her, I need to know that if I feel like I need to
know that I can rely on her, I don't know I don't quite understand it because I do in
a lot of ways feel the same about work that she does, not quite to the same extent, I
don't find work quite as anxiety inducing, I don't find work that anxiety inducing at
all but I do find it overwhelming in terms of the effect it has on my life and I think
probably a similar way to what she would do, what she does.
We both are a bit 80 capitalistic and that kind of thing it's just conflicting values,
I have multiple conflicting internal values because I also really want to fucking work,
I want to get a job, it's something that I want to do that feels important and not have
to work, work towards reaching some of those financial goals.
