What's... what do I actually mean when I say everything feels meaningless?
I'm sad that Holly left, and I'm sad that we won't have those experiences that I wanted,
and I'm sad that now that I'm not with her, not sad, I'm scared, or maybe things just
do feel like they mean less.
What does that mean, to say that they mean less?
John Vivecki talks about the three orders of meaning.
I don't know if it's the meaning of... the meaning behind our worldview, or meaning
in life.
I can't quite remember, but he talks about the normative, what one should do, I think,
the narrative, and the nomological, which is... the nomological is the way that things
cohere, the way they stick together, I guess.
Yeah, it's the way that things work together, the way that things stick, the way they make
sense in terms of each other, and the way that we... maybe the way they have a relationship?
And that's all.
I set out on this walk to start trying to work on expressing my ideas and bringing my
ideas together when it comes to philosophy.
But I'm just not really feeling it right now.
I really want to get away from the computer to do it, but I kind of feel like I need to
be in front of the computer to do it.
