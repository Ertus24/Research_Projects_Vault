It's like Holly just wants to pretend that we're friends and that we didn't break up
because she doesn't want to deal with the emotions around it but she doesn't want to
let go of this relationship.
So we have to pretend, so when we see each other we have to...
She keeps not wanting to, just like "I just want to talk about this now and get it out
of the clear the air and get it out of the way and then see each other next time and
just you know if things be okay."
It's not going to fucking be like that for fuck's sake.
We broke up!
If you don't want to fucking deal with the emotions, we should probably not be in fucking
contact.
And I understand not wanting to deal with the emotions.
We probably shouldn't be, we should probably be trying to be moving on.
But how do you do that and also have a fucking relationship where we're trying to be friends
just after we've broken up?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
