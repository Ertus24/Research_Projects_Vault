I felt like I had hope for the future when I was with Holly.
As much as I was losing sight of a lot of things.
I felt like I had hope for the future.
I had a hope for a future with her and I could see a future with her.
And now that we're not together I kind of don't have much hope for any future.
Everything kind of just seems worse and darker.
And after last year life just seems so much harder.
And darker and painful.
