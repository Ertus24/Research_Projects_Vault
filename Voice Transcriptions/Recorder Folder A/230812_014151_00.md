I've been thinking about it. I came across a new person today who, in a talk with John
Viveki about AI, I can't remember her name, I think it's Claire something. She's an African
American woman who started a company to do with emotional intelligence and teaching emotional
intelligence and awareness and stuff. And she's, after looking through her work a bit,
I actually quite respect her. She approaches things from a very much from a looking at
both sides kind of angle. And that got me thinking about what I respect in the people
I respect and what I respect in people. And what I value, which got me thinking about
how I've learned and grown from my relationship with Holly and that I value, I've learned
my issues with communication and boundaries and conflict avoidance. How they came up with
today with Dave, I realised I'd gotten into a pattern of avoiding conflict with Dave and
not talking about things, thinking about him negatively, but then not really giving him
the opportunity to, not really talking to him about any of the problems I have with
him or talking to him about finding out from him about how he's feeling and what's happening
and we did that a little bit this afternoon. I feel really proud of myself for. That is
all that is something I value. But that led me onto the thought that I actually really
respect Holly for her ability to, I don't think she's very good at seeing multiple sides of
things sometimes, but I really respect her for her ability to take accountability and
take responsibility for things and with given enough time and to process to really listen
and make a really strong effort to listen and make space for another person. It's far
from perfect at it, but she can be very, in some ways better than almost anyone I know
at, better than me at taking accountability for herself in the ways that she's, mistakes
she's made, taking responsibility, making space for others and listening to them. There's
more to it than that, there's something more there, like reflecting on the conversation
we had, the last conversation we had about and how she accepted blame for some things.
She's better at that than I am and I kind of aspire to be able to do what she does,
and the work that she's put into herself. I kind of aspire to that and I respect her
for that. Quite a lot actually. I look up to her a little bit. I'm proud of her. And
sometimes she's, in that regard she's a little bit of a role model for me like John Verbecky
is. That's something I really look up to as a model for myself. That's one of the things
that I really thought about that much, but it's one of the things that impressed me the
most about her when we were getting to know each other. It's part of why our relationship
continued, why I wanted to be with her is because of that. I recognize her ability to
do that and I value it very highly. I value it in others, I value it in myself. It's a
trait I highly value in people. And she's very, she displays it a lot given the time
and the space. Yeah, that's really nice to notice that. It's good to gather these qualities
in people that I respect, what makes me respect people. I've discovered this, but only that
makes me respect her. What it was about this lady I've discovered that makes me respect
her, what I respect about John Verbecky and it's usually being willing to be open and listen
to multiple sides, some variation of that. That's usually what I respect, that's because
that's what I value.
