It is 5.20pm on Monday? Saturday? Friday. Friday the 19th of May. I'm heading home from
my therapy appointment. Just want to talk about the appointment a little bit. So we
went over my results from the autism test I did, screeners, and it looks like
based on those results I don't have autism. I basically had no real
indicators other than on one of the tests I had a very like pretty like
pretty close to autistic sample score in I can't remember what it's called but it's
like attention it's like inability to move attention from one thing to the
other kind of like hyper focus and in another test I got clinically
significant in language apparently I think that's maybe because I missed
answered one of them wrong and the other one was because I and the other one
was pretty much like obsessive interests so those two definitely track so I
definitely have autism like levels of so I have autism like levels of like
difficulty like of hyper focus and of hyper focus and like obsessive interests
but I don't really have many other in any other indicators except for maybe a
little bit of social stuff potentially so we went over that we then we kind of
talked about some of this I think we kind of delved into that stuff a bit but
the main thing I want to there was one thing realization I can't have coming
out of out of it which was that the pattern of my life in terms of like what
I've done for Union work have kind of been the same as my interests hyper
focused you know dedicated and hyper focused to one thing and then lose
interest and stop caring about it and hyper focus on something else instead
you know I've done four different any degrees I'm thinking about doing another
one etc etc yeah so that's probably that's a pattern that plays out a lot of
my life and it's interesting to think about why you know what what's actually
happening that in each of those time you know why did I stop caring about
behavior change why did I stop caring about archaeology why did I stop caring
about behavior change and not wanting to do that anymore I think it's often
because I find that maybe things don't like it's like I'm in some ways
burying deeper like the deeper underlying problem I want to work on the
really deep underlying like the deepest level of the underlying problem kind of
thing maybe
she talked about icky guy a little bit
but yeah just the just the fact that yeah maybe I'm I'm jumping between
things because part of it is I lose interest I get more interested in
something else and part of it is because like I you know I go to uni and do the
stuff but it's not really what they're actually doing the thing is until I
actually do the thing like that's kind of reality things don't hold up in
reality to what I'm expecting maybe or yeah I don't know something like that
maybe but yeah the bigger thing I wanted to talk about was how I was feeling in
that therapy session I felt like she was she was it was the end of her week I was
her last session for the week she was visibly fucking exhausted and made a
point when I arrived that I think I was maybe like a minute or two late I think
maybe I know I felt like I was a little bit late and she was annoyed at me for
being late but she made a comment about how I don't know about you but my she
made a couple of comments about like I try not to finish at five kind of thing
which is a bit I don't know like because maybe because I was a late and she does
50 minute sessions but we went over by 10 minute I'm not sure but I'm not sure
if I'm I feel like I'm maybe reading into things there or I'm not sure but
regardless I'm not I'm feeling very kind of unsafe at the moment with her I'm
feeling judged quite a lot I'm feeling which is probably stuff I need to talk
her about but I'm finding myself feeling like I am annoying her or I'm
I mean I'm feeling guilty about being late or like at the time I'm doing it or
like she doesn't like the time we're doing it or something like I'm not quite
sure what's going on there but I feel I'm feeling bad and I'm feeling like
what it would that like she's kind of like only half paying attention so I'm
feeling like a bit under invalidated and like the stuff I'm talking I feel a
little bit like she's getting frustrated with this thing with me and
what I'm talking about the way I'm talking about things I feel like I'm
kind of waffling on or saying things and saying the wrong things or like going on
tangents or stuff which I don't think I necessarily am I just think maybe that
is a reflection of the fact that I feel how I feel about what I'm saying not so
much how she's and then she's a mirror for that and I'm like kind of reading
into her tiredness that thing but I think also I think I do actually think
she probably was a little bit shitty with me for being late she made the made
it like a passive aggressive point about it twice at the start and at the end
but yeah between that which is probably something I need to talk to her about
that that and the fact that she's not only available every six weeks I can
only ever seem to see her like after work right at the end of the day when
she's really fucking tired and she's a relationship therapist not a single
but she's okay with but the fact that she's a relationship therapist and she's
a relationship therapist I was seeing Holly with seeing Holly with her is yeah
I don't know it's just a bit like I I'm not really feeling safe with her I feel
like I need something else the work we're doing is I think the kind of work
I need to do but yeah I'm not feeling really all that good at the moment I'm
not it's it's too long between sessions I'm I basically wanted individual
therapist that I feel a bit safer with who's doing us would that I can do a
similar sort of thing with although at the same time I also kind of I kind of
want there was a reason I kind of wanted to do existential therapy because I kind
of want a therapist who's like at least a little bit cognizant of philosophical
stuff a bit and not just a therapist not just a psychologist now that I've
studied psychology and I'm really interested in the problems I've found
with science and psychology and such so but yeah that's probably an unreasonable
expectation and I did get a lot out of what we're doing anyway so yeah
regardless I'm going to change therapists I think and also I probably
gonna quit my job although maybe I'm just being avoided and try and like
avoiding conflict at work and etc etc but I feel like I've kind of made mine
by I've made a pretty decent request and they're not happy to do it they seem to
think I'm just not working me and Stan and not doing any fucking work when I
working hard enough not that we need more fucking people and three years fucking
micromanaging me although at the same time I think she's also maybe just doing
what's I'll be did coming around saying hey how you going except that she's
asked how long how long is it taking you to do that do this for this amount of
time and then do this for that amount of like she is micromanaging but I get what
she I get it like we do need to we do need to know what's actually happening
and I think I'd like to maybe have a conversation with it like I would be
very uncomfortable with it but I think I maybe we'll need to have a conversation
with her and say hey look I feel like you feel like I am I may just be being
anxious getting anxious and emotional about it but I feel like you think I am
not doing working hard enough or working smart enough or something is
there more you can feel you feel like I can be doing or something I just have a
fucking adult conversation with her about it rather than all this fucking
drama that's playing out that I'm trying desperately to fucking avoid whoops
I think
