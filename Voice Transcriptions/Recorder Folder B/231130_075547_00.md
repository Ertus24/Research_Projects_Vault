episode 9, he's talking about how, what Antisnees talks about with harmonious conversation,
like the ratio religio with other people is more important than argument or agreement,
basically. I think it's extremely important and extremely pertinent to myself and my values
and goals and what I want to do. It's a co-orientation so that we can train together to become more
virtuous, basically, which is that striving. It's that striving together that I think about
in the context of StarCraft and stuff like that.
A couple of books I now really want to read, Verbal Judo and Verbal Aikido. Both of those
come under Rosenberg's work on non-violent communication, which is important. I have
started reading it and I want to read more of it. Three books will all help you in the
real world to get into those harmonious conversations that Antisnees talks about, the middle point
in between, the middle way between agreement and conflict or argument or whatever.
