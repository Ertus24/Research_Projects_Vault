some thoughts about, um, some worries, I guess, about starting this project of doing philosophy,
because I know that I don't, there's so much I don't know, and as soon as I put anything
up I'm gonna get reamed by people who are like, "You have no idea what the fuck you're
talking about." Um, but the thing is, I don't, I don't, and, you know, and I don't buy that
that's a reason not to do it. That's actually more of a reason to do it. I don't buy that
we shouldn't put our ideas or thoughts out there because, like, you know, especially
if I'm noting that, if, you know, that, like, you know, a big disclaimer at the top of
the page, you know, I am learning this as I go, and there are, there's a great deal
that I haven't learned, and a great deal that I don't know about, that probably would,
you know, if I did, would change all of these things, but I can't know everything, I can't
learn everything, so I have to do what I can with what I've got, and in the process, presumably,
I will receive critiques from other people who will see things differently based on things
that I don't know about, and my ideas will change. And that's the whole fucking point
of it.
