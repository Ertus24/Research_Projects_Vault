So I just had a very long conversation with Holly, that was very very interesting, really
good conversation, yeah like really back and forward and engaging and we were talking about
her experiences and I was like really like vibing, I hate that word, really getting into
it and also like he was filling me with ideas.
But all that was interesting but that's not why I'm doing this, so she was talking about
at the beginning, at the start of the conversation about how she has a lot of hang ups around,
I can never quite express it as well as she does but she's been thinking about how maybe
she may be more lesbian than she thought and that she maybe has been like pushed into being
more, into being with men more than she, it's like basically she can't disentangle her attraction
to her interests, she's attracted to men and women but she has all the stuff that comes
up for her with men and has all the stuff that comes up for her with men, all the stuff
that comes up for her with men, like she said, she said it's not, I'm not sure if it's quite
the right word but sometimes even in our relationship, my relationship, she felt disgust in sex but
also just in being in a relationship with a man because of all of this, all of her experiences
with men but also because of like, like she talked about not being able to make decisions
and not showing who she really is and her personality and what she wants and that's
tied up with the stuff around men and women, it's like she's been with men but does she
actually want to be with men or is she just being kind of like pushed into it and doesn't
know how to make decisions, that's not exactly what she meant but yeah and all of that was
really important and valid and really interesting and really like impactful and meaningful to
me and it made me feel really sympathetic towards her and like a little bit protective
of her being like, that's really shit that all those things have happened to you and
I want to be here for you while you work those things out but at the same time, I don't,
I'm very very unsure, there's a very big part of me that's like, I don't want to be in a
relationship with you while you're going through that process because it affects me and the
ways that you act and think and believe sometimes go directly against my values and I don't
want to, I'm not at a phase in my life right now where I want to deal with that, I kind
of, you know, I'd like to be in another relationship but you know, between various factors it's
like, you know, I kind of want to try out other relationships, I don't want you to have
to be my only relationship, I don't know if I want to and you, having to do all that work
you have to do, that may be too complicated for me, for what I want, where I'm at right
now, what I want to have out of a relationship, what I'm willing to deal with but at the same
time I also, yep, sorry interruption from dad, but yes, at the same time, like it's
like, I don't know if I want to be on the other end of that while you work that out
in an intimate relationship but at the same time, you know, and plus other factors like,
you know, there's a lot to work through and I think I kind of don't actually want a long
term relationship right now and I also want to try out relationships with other people,
I want to have sex with other people, all those things but at the same time I also,
I do love you, you're important to me and I kind of want to support you through that
process but maybe as a friend, not as a lover or as a thing but at the same time, you know,
we do have a lot of chemistry, maybe we could do something like friendly benefits, I don't
know, I'm not sure. That's okay because it's all still up in the air but I'm kind of leaning,
as time's going on, I'm kind of leaning more towards remaining in contact and being friends
and being maybe, you know, not quite friends but something quite a little bit different
from that but not being in a committed long term relationship basically like we were and
which means also giving space for me to be in other relationships basically.
