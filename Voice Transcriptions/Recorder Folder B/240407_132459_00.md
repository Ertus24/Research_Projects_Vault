So, I've just been listening to a bunch of my, like some of my, basically my first folder
B notes that I put on here. And particularly I've just been listening to the one about
the month of July from last year or something like that. Where I was listening to episode
7 of "Philosophize This" which is about the Taoism and the Tao Te Ching and talking
about how the yin yang is so closely related and so similar to Heraclitus' ideas of unity
of opposites and that how that is actually a deeply, deeply important idea that way predates
Heraclitus and actually has had a very deep influence on Chinese culture. And how Heraclitus
basically has had very little influence on Western culture, Heraclitus and ideas, other
than basically being an opposite to, like something for Parmenides and the Eliatics
to argue against with Parmenides basically kind of in some ways, the ideas of Parmenides
kind of becoming almost like the basis of the Western philosophical and tradition because
they were so deeply important and formative for Plato who is kind of like the founding
figure of Socrates and being the founding figure of Western tradition. So Taoism is really
Taoism and the yin yang is really important. So it's like maybe essentially the West is
the intellectual philosophical tradition of Parmenides and his ideas of non-nothingness
and absolute unity and all of that and the East is in some ways kind of like the intellectual
tradition or at least China is the intellectual tradition and which means a fair amount of
East Asia, the intellectual tradition of, in some ways, the intellectual tradition of
Heraclitus' ideas of no-thingness and all of that stuff and the synchrotisation of those
two is maybe what the next step is and I was thinking about writing a story about how the
next big step in our culture is writing a thing a couple of hundred years' time where
we have gotten this philosophy that's a synthesis, like a worldview that is a synthesis of those
two grand streams and how China, basically take some of those things that are happening
at the moment and with China and like, I'm going to pause it for a sec, is he taking,
extrapolating from where we are at the moment into the future and then trying to, like writing
a story that's a couple of hundred years in the future, maybe the kind of Russia-China
block actually kind of reaches ascendancy and we get a re-burgeoning of Chinese, kind of
that Heraclitian culture, that yin-yang culture and then because at the moment the West is
kind of taking over the world and other ideas are being squished by the Western worldview
that would allow like a kind of a pushback against that and then give space for a synthesis,
synthesisation of those two ideas. But then I thought about the fact that from
what I have heard, and this is now what I want to go research there because I'm on the
way to the UQ Library, what I have heard is that modern Chinese culture is like quite
heavily divorced from old Chinese culture in a lot of ways. That's, old Chinese culture,
you know like after the Cultural Revolution and Mao-like modern Chinese culture has very
little resemblance to old Chinese culture, which means that maybe what we have now out
of China, like that kind of very long strand of Eastern thought maybe doesn't exist the
same way or doesn't exist at all or has been watered down and now I want to go do some
research on the history of like, basically the history that led up to Mao and Communism
in China, like where did that come from, how did that come about, how many of the old ideas
were lost, how much of what happened with the Cultural Revolution in China and Communism
and the democratic movement was a reaction against those sort of old ways of thinking
and basically looking to Taoism in, like the history preceding the 19th, the 18th, 20th
and 19th century history of China that preceded the Cultural Revolution and Mao and the split
the democratic party and then see also like, and then also do some research on Taoism in
general and the importance of Taoism in Chinese culture and the effect it's had on East Asian
culture and if there's any interlinks there between, basically between Taoism and those
ideas and traditional Chinese culture and the culture we have now.
