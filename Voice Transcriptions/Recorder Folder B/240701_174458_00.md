So right at the end of episode 205 of Philosophize This, which is about the problems with meritocracy,
he talks about how most of the systems we have, like communism, capitalism, liberalism,
etc., etc., are about trying to get rid of or manage the disagreements that arise or
basically get rid of the negative emotions that arise because of disagreements between
people and things like that. He says maybe that's not what we need to do because we're
always going to have disagreements. What we need is a way to channel those disagreements
in a better way. And he mentions after that the work of somebody I think it's called,
she's called Sheila Mouffe or something like that, and her work on agonism, which is exactly
what I am interested in. So that's another mark in the, that's another thing in the My
World View column. The Chantal Mouffe, I'm guessing that's M-O-U-F and her concept of
agonism. Boy oh boy do I want to look into that. This episode and the last episode are
based on the work of Michael Sandel, who is the guy who wrote the Meritocracy Trap book.
