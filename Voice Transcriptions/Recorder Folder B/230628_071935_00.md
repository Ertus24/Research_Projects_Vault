Listening to episode 180 of Philosophize This, this is the second episode on consciousness
and philosophy of mind. This is just a really interesting point. He's talking about panpsychism
and how philosopher Philip Goff, Goff or Goff, I'm not quite sure which one he's saying,
is one of the founding figures or one of the really important figures in this. And he wrote
a book called The Galilean something, basically talking about how Galileo made a decision
because he wanted to be able to explain things with mathematics. He basically made a decision
to put the, decisions he made basically made turn science into a largely quantitative thing
and determined that qualitative experiences happen in the mind of the person and not in
the object basically. And since then has basically meant that science is not really equipped
to deal with qualitative experiences. It's mostly about quantitative things and particularly
with how things behave, which explains a lot about all the stuff I've been thinking about
with quantitative stuff recently. This was a lot more, the feeling and thought I was
having was a lot more interesting than what I've just said. I feel like it's a bigger
deal than I'm making it, but this links to a lot of the stuff I've been interested in
about quantitative versus qualitative and left brain versus right brain and all that
