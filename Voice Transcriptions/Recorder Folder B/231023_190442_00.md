Listening to episode 26 of 'Waiting for the Meaning Crisis'
It's the episode where he starts talking about cognitive science in this particular section that I'm up to
He's talking about metaphor
This is at...
For fuck's sake
This is at...
25 minutes in
He's talking about metaphor
And it raises an important point
Which is that metaphor allows us to both keep something the same and also see how it's different
Which is precisely what I'm concerned about people not being able to do
Not exactly do metaphor, but that's, you know, understand that
You see difference while also seeing similarity
Which is a right hemisphere thing
