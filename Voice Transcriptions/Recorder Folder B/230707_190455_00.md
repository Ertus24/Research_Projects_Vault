to basically hold them smart at nuclear gunpoint.
And that would not be a good idea, so he gave it to Russia to sort of balance things out.
Which arguably has its own drawbacks, but at the same time, the idea was yeah,
the first to get nuclear weapons, if they were the only power with it,
they could basically hold any country to ransom.
It's like a power imbalance for being the first kind of thing.
But it's close to infinite in that way in history, because it's a level of destructive power you just can't win against.
There was actually a TED talk I listened to the other day about how in the 20th century
we had a unipolar world with Great Britain originally, and then America became the unipower,
and then it became the Soviets and America with a bipolar world.
It was like, what's going to happen in the future?
It's like we're increasingly becoming a multipolar world with China and India is another growing one,
and America and the EU, if it gets its shit together.
But it's not just going to be about socioeconomics.
There's going to be another power that sort of sorts all this out, which is technology companies.
Disney.
But for example, Facebook can influence elections.
They can choose what gets shared and what doesn't, and already we saw that with the American election.
I think we're pretty close to the point where they are more powerful than governments.
Yes, so that's what they're saying.
Black Rock, OK, that's probably a better example.
They are more powerful than governments and every other corporation.
Black Rock, probably the wealthiest corporation on the planet.
They own everything.
Not that I subscribe to these notions, but for everyone going, "Oh, Netflix, it's woke, it's woke."
And they release a movie and it bombs.
And then they release another movie pushing some agenda.
That's because Black Rock's like, "We'll stop funding you if you don't.
We don't care if this movie loses $200 million.
That makes no difference to us. You do this because we told you to, or we're going to bankrupt you."
Including basically every platform, every company.
Like Disney goes to them for loans. Governments go to them for loans.
They own most of the property. They have the largest property portfolio on the planet.
They're like an asset-honing company.
Yeah, that's it. And they're worth like $6 trillion or something, $7 trillion.
They made a deal with Zvensk in Ukraine to help rebuild Ukraine after the war.
And everyone's like, "No, don't do it. It'd be better to go slow than take their money."
No one's allowed to be listed on the Chinese stock market except for a country.
Like, you can't invest. If you're a Chinese citizen, you can't invest in the stock market.
It's all the party. Just say you're a business. We're going to list you.
And you can be on the exchanges though.
And foreign companies, I believe, are not allowed at all onto the market.
Blackrock is the exception.
You put us on your thing and they're like, "Okay, sir."
Which is pretty, like a thing showing how powerful they are.
That is an uncomfortable thing.
It is. It is. It is the amount of...
And you know, America has had anti-monopoly laws for a long time.
And they're an American company, obviously.
Because they just ask for tax concessions and just get them, so...
What do you call a world where like a power structure is corporatocracy or something?
I'm not sure.
And is that the worst thing?
I mean, arguably what they're engaging in is more like a corporate oligarchy.
Because the crucial thing is that if you had something named something like corporatocracy,
it would imply that the structure and processes of corporations as an idea
played a role in the power making and decision making of how this works.
Whereas it sounds more like a company that is a company in the sense that it owns assets,
maybe has shareholders.
Yeah, it does.
But ultimately the driving force is...
Like it's not running things according to the ideas that are at the core of what corporations are.
Corporations in the colloquial sense.
Yeah, I think the tinfoil approach is that there's this cabal of ten old dudes at the top
puppeteering strings of countries and things where it's probably more that it's just
an impossibly big machination that runs itself and like the cogs just turn.
We need money, we will write on a ledger, therefore thing, and it just shapes.
There's this guy I read quite a lot of, David Chapman, and he's writing that.
He's the guy who did that.
"Certainty isn't certain, you can be certain of that thing."
He talks about how entities that exist...
We maybe need to expand our concept of what an actor or an agent or an entity is,
saying companies might not be a living organism, but things like ideologies...
You're talking about emerging systems.
Like ant colonies.
Bigger than the individual.
There's no one driving it.
A corporation or an ideology is still an actor, it still has an agent...
An agency in the world.
Yes, and it creates...
Or humans.
Yes, and it's still like a living being, it is still motivated to continue itself.
Just for a corporation, that's like rather than food, it's money basically.
So, none of the human beings involved might have anything to do with any of that,
but as a system it's self-perpetuating.
Which one is it?
The big one in the middle.
Right, no, otherwise...
And then the big one in the middle.
...and people, dedicating huge portions of the best years of their career trying to find answers to these things.
Is it just for their intellectual amusement?
Is it just so they can drink cheap wine from Trader Joe's with their neck-beard friends and feel smart for a while?
Well, clearly not.
Clearly there's another way to be thinking about that conversation going on in the philosophy of mind.
And I eventually realized that what that is, is that every further conversation that we have about anything that matters to us as people,
ultimately emerges out of the assumptions that we're making about the nature of consciousness.
And then our understanding of what a human mind is that emerges out of that.
Holy fuck, I just realized, was Socrates actually a neck-beard?
And it's like, "Well, actually!"
The meme, the literally...
Sorry, you can't talk in stills.
No, I'm going to pause it because I wanted to talk about that.
Right.
Except I forgot what he fucking said.
Is the remote now the conch shell?
Yeah, that's...
Is the remote now the what?
The conch shell.
Some of these must have been really fucking annoying though.
Just imagine, you know he's next to you, and you're just going to say any affirmative sentence about anything.
And he's like, "Well, enough."
Isn't it great that you're also good at...
Imagine how refined you're thinking would be after years of being friends with this guy.
Or how much you would have hated him and killed yourself.
Well, I have a friend who was like this, and I actually really enjoy it.
But he would just go to the muck and harass people.
Well, keep in mind, he lived in a society where, arguably, from his point of view, everyone was engaging really poorly with things.
So yes, he would have been a pain in the ass, but maybe they needed it.
Wake up, sheeple!
Yeah, you wake up sheeple, but you're somewhat right.
Yeah, that's literally the point.
The only thing I have to say, because I don't play them, in defense of the modern Assassin's Creed games, is their portrayal of him is amazing.
Of who? Socrates.
He's a pain in the ass, and it's great.
Because he's just always asking questions about things.
Every single thing the character says.
That's fucking cool.
I got really annoyed.
It was the character.
Fuck off, Socrates.
It might also feel different back then, when you do genuinely have to get a move on and you starve to death all of the time.
Yeah, there'll be a lot of people pushing the cart.
Yeah, only talking to him, you're losing customers that will get you dimmed tonight.
Fuck off, Socrates.
Have you ever thought about how that cart makes you a bit like Sisyphus?
For example, any conversation about morality, even at the most basic, even distant...
Fuck.
Hello, everybody.
Ah, fuck.
Can't you press up and then auto-track it across?
...the philosophy surrounding artificial intelligence.
We were at like, through your...
...the philosophical debates that are going on, better because of something they never could have seen coming anyway.
But eventually my curiosity got the better.
I had to ask the question, why are so many people talking about this stuff right now?
Why are so many brilliant people dedicating huge portions of the best years of their career trying to find answers to these things?
Is it just for their intellectual amusement?
Is it just so they can drink cheap wine from Trader Joe's with their neckbeard friends and feel smart for a while?
Well, clearly not.
Clearly there's another way to be thinking about these conversations going on with the philosophy of mind.
And I eventually realized that what that is, is that every further conversation that we have about anything that matters to us as people...
...ultimately emerges out of the assumptions that we're making about the nature of consciousness.
And then our understanding of what a human mind is that emerges out of that.
For example, any conversation about morality, even at the most basic hedonistic level of avoiding pain and seeking pleasure...
...even that is grounded on us maximizing certain subjective conscious experiences of the world and moving away from others.
This extends to any conversation about relationships.
Relationships, you could make the case, is just talking about the details of how two or more conscious people are interacting.
Politics is just a strategy of how conscious beings try to get what they want in relation to other conscious beings.
What I'm saying is, whether these questions have answers that we've settled on or not, and whether you realize that you're doing it or not...
...you are bringing assumptions about the nature of consciousness to bear that affect your thoughts on everything.
And that's part of what I want to do on this series.
Okay.
What do you guys think of that?
No thoughts.
Well, I mean, it seems true.
Any behavior you exhibit or thing you say you believe implicitly carries assumptions about things like that in it, usually.
So you can't get away from philosophy.
I mean, I guess, specifically, thinking of it, it's like consciousness and understanding consciousness kind of underlying everything else...
...because everything we do is kind of about...
No. Because, like, well, that takes all of, say, everything primal about you as a person and just puts that in the bin.
Like, you could take a person and switch off their cognitive ability to think and they can still forage and hunt and fuck and that's like...
...those are completely distinct from consciousness, I suppose, in a sense.
But then that brings up, like, do monkeys think... do you think monkeys philosophize about their things?
If not, are they conscious? Well, yes, but...
It probably has implications for everything to a greater or lesser degree.
But if he's saying that it's, like, a really important be-all and end-all thing for everything, that could be a bit of a stretch.
That would be a bit reductive.
I do question his qualifications, I reckon.
Ooh.
Bob move.
So I want to talk about why these conversations about the nature of consciousness are important.
Why something that's seemingly so theoretical actually goes on to have huge impacts on real people all around you.
How it affects not just your own personal moral policy that you're doing life by.
What do you mean, "seemingly so theoretical"? It is theoretical.
It's definitionally just theory.
Well, as he thinks he can somehow demonstrate it objectively, but...
It's still applicable even if it's theoretical.
Yeah, I think that's the point to make. If it's so theoretical and abstract and removed from everyday life, how can it have a consequence?
Or how can it affect our everyday life kind of thing?
I said that about Matt.
But our political policies as well. I'll give examples of alternative timelines.
What would have happened if society adopted a different set of precepts about the nature of consciousness?
How would that have potentially changed things? How would the world look today?
And I'll do it while offering up as many of these different theories being discussed today as I can.
So you can not only be more self-aware of where you fall in the discussion,
but hopefully by the end of this you'll be able to understand other people's positions better as well.
Now let's get into it.
And if I've convinced you at all that learning more about these conversations and the philosophy of mind is important,
one of the first questions you've got to be asking as a modern person after hearing that,
certainly a question I was asking years ago, is if I want to know more about what consciousness is,
why wouldn't I just study science and the brain?
Why are philosophers weighing in on this stuff at all?
Just look at the last hundred years.
We've learned so much about the brain just through advancements in the area of neuroscience.
I mean, in terms of understanding how brain states are connected to mental states,
we've come so far that it's not surprising people out there would think that there's no end to that progress in sight.
That if we just keep running these experiments,
we keep learning as much as we can about the physical neurochemical makeup of the brain,
that we'll eventually be able to understand everything about subjective experience.
But then again, there's also...
Maybe.
We said we're not guaranteed that we wouldn't.
We've discussed this a lot in the past.
That's why I really wanted to fucking listen to this episode.
So you basically boiled down to the thing of, like, well, once you...
Thankfully, in a sense, that's a solvable problem,
because it's purely an engineering problem for the moment.
And it's possible that if you're able to map a brain one-to-one,
then you flick the switch, if you can simulate a consciousness,
and it's indiscernible from a physical consciousness,
and then you can start manipulating it, then, yeah, basically there is no...
Extra. It is a purely mechanical system.
With input and output, that's it.
I mean, there's a lot more you can dig into that, but...
It's a bit of a moot thing until we finish mapping it,
but we're getting there, we're working on it.
Plenty of examples throughout the history of philosophy of people
that thought that studying things empirically
was eventually going to lead to a total understanding of it,
only to be disappointed by how much other modes of analysis
factor into understanding something fully.
For example, psychology, or linguistics, or sociology.
There's a type of conceptual analysis...
What does he mean...
He's pulling on disciplines here, rather than methods of analysis.
Like, what about those disciplines does he think stands separate?
He was saying that in these fields, we used to believe that
the more empirical data we could get, we could have a complete understanding,
but it hasn't been the case.
I think he's also pushing back against that "just using science" kind of thing.
True. And of course, empiricism alone does not get us all the information we need.
But arguably, we're going through a bit of a crisis in fields like psychology right now
because of how unempirical a lot of the data is.
So I wouldn't even say that we're in a position where we're like,
"Oh, we've been empirical enough, and we're finding that we need to be less empirical."
There's probably going to be a very large chunk of it that could
have to be dealt with through philosophizing about it.
But we're far from the point where we fit the most rigorous approach to getting data.
Even in archaeology recently, they've been using old sets of data
that they've just built everything on, and then they go back and they're like,
"Man, the methodology for this was shit."
We're having a lot of date clock issues in the history space right now,
in the same way that a lot of science is getting uplifted,
where the date markers are getting shifted back up to 100,000 years prior
to or even tens of thousands of years back, depending on the different thing.
We just, because some dickhead once upon a time was like,
"This crevasse must have been done by this water and this geological thing,
therefore it was 8,000 years."
And everybody just believed that as absolute facts.
That was the starting peg, and then everything was built on that.
They're like, "It was 18,000 years. You're a fucking idiot."
And it's like, "Oh shit, everything has now been shifted back, and that's problematic."
Also, a little bit of a sidetrack, but about the Titanic the other day
on Behind the Bastards podcast, it said like...
Oh, that's the actual name of the podcast.
Yeah, Behind the Bastards. It's a really good podcast.
When you were entering it before, I thought you were just saying that it was beautiful.
No, it's the name of the podcast.
But they said like, one of the reasons why it was such an intriguing thing,
even when it originally sunk, was because a lot of the survivors were women,
and they all...
Oh, the actual Titanic.
Yeah, they all recorded, they all said the ship broke into two.
It was horrible and everything.
And all of the construction engineers and all the men were like,
"No, it didn't. You women are just delirious, and you women are nothing about it."
It wouldn't have broken like that.
And for their entire lives, it fucking broke into two.
You're not hearing us. It did like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Women's opinion, you don't know shit.
And then finally, when they did find it, they were like, "Oh, fuck me, it snapped them two."
Worthy dating.
Yeah, but they were adamant that they had the data,
and they've worked in that field, and they've built ships before,
they know how it would have broken, but they were wrong.
Man-splaining.
Yeah, the pinnacle of it even. You just survived narrowly.
It was pretty cool how they found the Titanic as well. You know how they found it?
No.
It was...
Dr. Penny?
No, so...
The paint on the ice blue?
No, no, no, no, no.
So there was a guy...
It was him!
There was a guy who was asked to locate two American nuclear subs that went missing.
And America did not want Russia to know that they had lost two nuclear subs.
So the guy was like an expert at underwater sonar.
He was like, "I want to find the Titanic."
And they're like, "You find the subs, and yeah, we'll give you the money for it,
and you can say you're looking for the Titanic.
And if you find the Titanic, great, but we really want those subs."
And so he found the two subs, and he also found the Titanic.
"It was the Titanic that we were looking for! You found the Titanic!"
Results.
Wouldn't it be awkward if you were that guy and you did find the Titanic and not the subs?
You'd have to convince them that you did try?
He also found the Bismarck as well.
Was that the... You should listen to Sabotage.
Was this Nathan Drake? I don't know this man.
He was the ultimate trigger on tape.
Maybe it's about someone that just left the fucking dock or something and then...
It basically attacked.
It's not with the US government, you can do anything.
They put a lot of air guns on the ship, except the Allies were using slow-as-fuck planes.
And they just could not line it up because they were like, "Why are they moving so slow?"
All their calculations were meant for faster planes, and so it just got bombed to ship.
Sometimes it pays to be the worst.
Yes.
Our daughter can't keep up with how bad you mummified it.
Goddamn British, how disappointing.
You've ruined everything.
That's why I lost the battle of Britain.
You have people that thought that studying things empirically was eventually going to lead to a total understanding of it,
only to be disappointed by how much other modes of analysis factor into understanding something fully.
For example, psychology, or linguistics, or sociology.
There's a type of conceptual analysis that philosophers do that's just outside the purview of science.
Which is to say that the way we conceptually organize things oftentimes precedes the scientists doing their work.
It gives them the assumptions they have to use when doing their work.
Classic example of this, just so you can understand what I'm talking about.
Sorry, I know we're getting hung up on this.
Science matters in the physical.
I think this guy actually misunderstands science as a discipline a little bit.
Because philosophy is a part of the scientific process.
You can't have empiricism without forming hypotheses, and thus you have to work on hypotheticals.
And that is philosophical work.
You can't be a decent scientist without being able to do some level of philosophical thinking.
And in fact, one of the worst things about current scientific education in the universities is that they don't emphasize the philosophy of science education.
They don't teach it at all, basically.
Yeah, like, sine 1000 is mandatory, but they've actually reduced the amount of philosophy of science they teach in it, for example, at UQ.
I'm not saying he's completely wrong, I just think he's stretching it a little bit too far outside the wheelhouse.
Like, scientists, good scientists, ought to be doing this and do this.
And the forming of hypotheses is different, but it's not outside the box, as you said.
Like, not two entirely separate processes going on.
Yeah, like, one sort of requires the other.
Because you have to think about the data you get if you are any kind of empiricist in order to get...
Like, the data that you...
But that doesn't necessarily mean you're using philosophical concepts, like...
Well, okay, but if you want to do it in any systematic way, there is a philosophy behind it, one way or the other.
Right, like, that is philosophical work.
Because I do the analysis of information and I am interpreting it, and I can do that in a philosophically rigorous way, or I can do that in a haphazard way.
But one way or the other, if I'm doing it in a systematic or justified way, it's going to be philosophically rigorous in one way or another.
Like, it might be according to one set of assumptions or values or preferences or something.
Like, you can do it well or you cannot, and the moment you start trying to do it well, it's kind of in philosophy's wheelhouse.
Yeah.
It's my position, at least.
[audio from video]
[audio from video]
[laughter]
I'll let it go.
What's that?
It's a little bit...
No, no, maybe we should put...
I love how Spotify goes like, "You're listening more than 30 seconds, I'm going to put the thing down."
Oh, fuck.
Yes.
What was it?
No, it just had issues.
It was like, "Oh, they've got primary characteristics like size and shape and weight and stuff."
And secondary characteristics like color and...
Smell and taste.
That's their primary thing, those are just chemical and physical reactions to like, light waves.
How is that not a primary characteristic?
Color might be the only distinguishing feature of something other than...
This is John Locke saying this, which was like the 1600s.
Oh, right.
Fair God.
But we could say something about like, the vetting of this information by the podcaster.
No, but...
No, that's right, fair enough.
Yeah, he didn't present that as something that is questionable, he just presented it as like...
This is established.
Yeah, which it far from is.
I mean, we talked about this when we walked to the car.
This is before we met you, but...
You were talking about qualia and the qualic of things.
The interpretation of it, or sorry, the translation of that physical experience into something that feels like something.
You could make a claim that that one aspect of it is still in the secondary characteristic category?
As in, why does...
So why, not just why do you feel happy, but like, why does feeling happy feel like something?
Yeah, okay.
Because you could make that part of it put in its own category.
I think that is the secondary quality is what they're basically talking about.
Yes, although we can criticize John Locke from the point of view, he's thinking very...
He's not actually using these terms, but he's thinking of the left brain, right brain kind of world of logic and hard things,
and create like, you know, experiential things as being a lot more separate than they are.
Right.
But I think you're right to be frustrated.
Because there's something wrong about the way we're breaking down reality at the root.
Actual experiments that may be done by a scientist.
In other words, some people in...
But then they also have secondary qualities, things like color, text, smell, or taste.
Now that is a way that philosophers chop up and conceptually analyze the world prior to any actual experiments that may be done by a scientist.
In other words, some people in these discussions going on today think that it may be the case that the reason these conversations about consciousness are so mysterious to us
is because there's something wrong about the way we're breaking down reality at the root level of concepts.
And that if only we shifted something at that fundamental level, everything else would start to make a lot more sense.
This is why philosophers and scientists have to work together on this stuff these days.
Philosophers and scientists need each other.
Philosophers rethink reality at a conceptual level, and then scientists run brilliant experiments to get to the actual empirical data.
But while scientists can and often have to compartmentalize themselves into their specialized field to be able to do their work,
philosophers can take a step back, and they have the luxury of looking at all the discoveries going on in psychology or linguistics or neuroscience,
and they can try to come up with the theories to how all these different fields link together.
Science tells you what the world is. Philosophy tells you how to interpret it.
Put another way, no matter how brilliant of a neuroscientist you may be,
yes, but scientists can do that work.
you will still always have to have a philosophy to be able to interpret the data that you're gathering.
Now, we'll talk about many examples of all of these, but not before we get some clarity on what may be the most cringe question of them all.
I mean, if you think these discussions are cringe sometimes because there's no clear solution to arrive at,
then the most cringe-lord question of all of them is this. What is consciousness? What is it?
You can spend the rest of your life thinking about that question and really not get much of anywhere.
And it wouldn't be your fault. It truly is a modern mystery.
It's actually kind of exciting. And maybe somebody smart listening to this will be the one to solve it one day,
but philosophers and scientists so far are nowhere near a clear definition on it.
One thing they do agree on though, most of the time, that's valuable for you to know,
as someone I'm trying to equip with tools in this series,
is that they seem to at least agree on which conversations we're currently having about it.
We may not know what consciousness is, but we do know what we're talking about.
We're talking about a certain kind of subjective experience that we all seem to have
that is distinct from other things going on in your mind right now
that are usually presumed to be going on at a lower level of experience, whatever that means.
People sometimes talk about these two different levels of consciousness as "access consciousness" on the one hand
versus "phenomenal consciousness" on the other.
So "access consciousness" is going to be that lower one,
term first used by the philosopher-scientist Ned Block.
"Access consciousness" is made up of the entire process we're all very familiar with
the fact that you are a human mind that's living in a universe,
you're taking in this external stimuli from the world that's been with you all the time,
and there's some complex process going on.
You're taking in these phenomena, you're forming them into perceptions,
you're forming those perceptions into memories,
you're directing your attention in one place or another that's important to you.
These things and more are all a part of what some people call "access consciousness."
It is the area of our conscious experience that allows us to access information
from the external world that is then used by our cognitive systems.
And again, neuroscience has been studied in all those things I just mentioned,
and neuroscientists are pretty great at being able to point to correlations
between states of the brain and those mental processes.
They've obviously identified the specific parts of the brain that deal with memories,
that deal with perceptions, that deal with attention, and all that's fantastic.
But there still seems to be something else to our conscious experiences of reality
that lies outside of this "access consciousness,"
and it seems to be something that neuroscience hasn't quite figured out yet.
And that is, well, one way to put it, is that it feels like something to be me,
that I have a subjective experience that seems distinct from anything else that's going on in my brain.
For example, the way scientists and philosophers will often talk about it in these conversations,
they'll ask, "What does it feel like to see the redness of an apple?"
That's one of these people like to use a lot. Can you describe that?
Picture trying to describe what it's like to see the color red to something that's never seen color before,
or to describe what chocolate tastes like to someone that's never tasted chocolate.
How do you do that?
Well, the more you think about it, the more it starts to become a pretty tricky problem.
Because in what sense, it doesn't look like something you can just describe to someone with words.
It's something you have to experience.
Even completely seriously, there is something about these kinds of questions
that sounds very Joe Rogan, I just...
I'm just asking questions.
I'm just asking questions, but also like, "Wow, man."
It is deep, but it's not immediately apparent what is, where the depth lies in such a question.
What do you mean?
Okay, listen to how it sounds. How do you describe to someone who's never had chocolate,
what chocolate tastes like?
Well, that's easy. I mean, deep, man.
Like, at the surface level, it's not immediately apparent why there's something there.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't... Maybe I'm the idiot here, because I can't... These aren't great examples.
They're not the best, because you can't actually describe through other things, but you're still always...
Unless they know what that experience is like.
Like, "Oh, it's sweet. What is sweet?"
We're always reading by analogy.
You can give someone that experience. Well, okay, maybe the chocolate example is just a bad example.
You can't show someone the color red.
Like, well, this thing explains to someone who's never had chocolate what chocolate tastes like.
What's like, "Have you ever eaten food?" Because we only taste like...
I know we taste more than five things. That's my intro, but there are...
We taste other things that we taste like chocolate.
There's only holistic profiles you could explain through easy descriptors.
Well, it's a little bit bitter, and it's a little bit this, and it's a little bit that.
And then their idea of chocolate might be vastly different, wildly different from what it is.
It's the same as explaining it red.
But that's no different to a sighted person than the whole classic, "Well, your red's not my red."
We're just talking about degrees of separation between individual experiences, not an inability to perceive different things entirely without having to.
Man, that's going to sound great on the fucking dictaphone.
I think what it's...
It's that experience of the thing being red that is what he's talking about.
The subjective experience of redness is what he's talking about here.
I think it would be easy without it, because...
Well, I could have never stopped to think about it, but...
I don't know if I really...
In the same way that I...
Well, now I can think about, I can perceive my blood flow, which is not an active process, but I still have a perception of it.
Like, your heart. You can feel your heart beating.
That's just actively making your heart beat.
But...
What was the OG question there? What was the...
Um, well, let me go back.
Isn't the human brain the biggest trouble ever, though?
It's evolved consciousness, it's evolved everything, and it's like...
Is my liver doing well? I don't know.
You do know, dammit!
It's part of you, not telling.
But, that's also a bit more of a... hang on, should we...
It's too protected, sorry.
That's also a little bit distinctive to humans, because there are plenty of animals that can be like, "I'm gonna slow my heart down!"
Like, "Stop!"
Like, uh, micro bats.
But, do they actually make a decision?
Yeah, it's an active process, and I'm like, "Well, okay, it might be like, proper stimuli and stuff."
Like, "The temperature is this, I'm gonna do this."
Well, that's like, you don't decide to get tired, it's like, it's nighttime now.
Oh, okay, well they can be like, "I'm scared, I'm gonna lower my heart rate, because I don't want the owl to be able to hear it."
But is that something that they're deciding to do, or is it something that happens to them?
It's a fear response, I mean, to decide to run away when you're...
But implicit in your question is the assumption that we choose.
Yeah.
I... wait.
It very well could be that everything we ever do is just the result of all of that coming to bad.
Which, honestly, I am actually like, I think we need to downgrade our ideas of the self quite significantly, but...
Experiencing red.
Can we go back like 15 seconds?
We are, we are.
I'm still just hanging around, trying to wrap my head around that one.
So, what's the point here? What's the point he's trying to make?
Um, do you... does anyone experience red is my... my question.
Well, we make certain associations with it.
Well, it's not even about the associations, it's about the...
But that's subjectivity.
Right.
Like, for example, like, you know, we see red as, you know, violent or passionate or angry or whatever.
China sees it as luck.
Yeah.
And that's based on culture.
But you... we would get a different subjective response to that stimuli.
But it's not even about, like, at the most basic level, like...
Well, the thing is, it's possible, I'm not going to say it is the case, but it is possible that there is not an easy, most basic level of experiencing even something like the colour.
Because even though, for example, when you... when...
The colour exists in some physical sense that goes beyond your interpretation of it.
But if we're talking about consciousness, your experience of it is heavily influenced by everything else going on in that moment.
And weirdly enough, even things from, like, whether your bladder is full and how your kidneys are doing and, like, the temperature of the room.
Yeah, our experience is...
All the way down to, like, what other colours are around it, the level of light, etc.
You know, brown is very hard to perceive, for example, on a screen.
Yeah.
Or on a bright room, because...
Or there's that thing where it's... it's like the same... it's like you look at two different things and they look like they're different colours, but it's just because of the surrounding things.
And when you, like, instantly change them, they're actually, like, the exact fucking same colour.
And so it's not that the physical reality has changed based on your perception, but if we're talking about your experience of it, that may not have a fixed...
Like, sorry. You could probably say there is a fixed thing you just experienced.
You know, you could replicate all those stimuli again.
But it's not about replicate, it's the actual experience. It's not the external, like, this is this exact hue we can recreate.
Yeah, yeah.
It's about the actual experience of that hue.
What I'm saying is the only way you could have probably the exact same experience of the hue is to get all the sliders of things back to where they were.
Yeah, exactly. Which is probably, like, infinite.
Well, it's information theory. It's information theory, but it's not infinite, and therefore it's very insoluble.
That's a good pre-chorus. I just want to nail everyone's thing when you play it again. I'm going to, like, try and recapture what he's saying here.
And that is, well, one way of putting it is that it feels like something to be me.
That I have a subjective experience that seems distinct from anything else that's going on in my brain.
For example, the way scientists and philosophers will often talk about it in these conversations, they'll ask, "What does it feel like to see the redness of an apple?"
That's one of these people like to use a lot. Can you describe that?
Picture trying to describe what it's like to see the color red to somebody that's never seen color before.
Or to describe what chocolate tastes like to someone that's never tasted chocolate.
How do you do that?
Well, the more you think about it, the more it starts to become a pretty tricky problem.
Because in one sense, it doesn't really seem like something you can just describe to someone with words.
It's something you have to experience.
And then in another sense, if you wanted to try to explain it in purely scientific terms,
you know, if you wanted to try to break it down and understand all the components of what's going on at the neurochemical level
and then look at the atoms that make up the apple or something, well, the atoms that make up the apple are not red.
It has something to do with the way your conscious experience filters reality that makes it look red to you.
And then it's a totally different thing, entirely beyond whatever mental filtration system you've got going on,
to then have a subjective experience of redness that's on top of that.
Where part of it all is that there's a unified stream of you being a continuous self with continuity to time,
continuity to your identity, where the billions of phenomena that come into your awareness are presented to you not in their full complexity,
but in a digested format that you seemingly are able to organize.
What is that? Why do we even do something like that?
Some philosophers call this "phenomenal consciousness."
Some call it "subjective experience."
Some call these subjective experiences "qualia."
That's the common word philosophers will use.
And some say that these qualia cannot ever be reducible to purely physical states of the brain.
The implication being, when you say that, is that to some philosophers, no matter how advanced neuroscience ever gets,
it will never be able to find the neural correlates of consciousness they seek,
or it will never be able to find the specific states of the brain that give rise to these subjective experiences.
Many different minds and philosophers give this.
It's not that he's necessarily wrong, but the way he's phrasing it may imply things, depending on the listener,
that aren't the correct phrasing of it.
What do you mean?
It is not guaranteed, but seemingly likely that we will get to the point where every single subjective experience is linkable in some manner to its cause in the brain.
That doesn't mean that why it feels like something will be explained by that.
But if it turns out we are just a brain in the body, then there is a physical correlate for everything you feel.
That doesn't explain why it feels like something, but it explains where the experience came from.
I think we can do the what faster than we can do the why.
Instead of trying to think of it as just mapping the brain, again coming from the compsci view,
I think it's probably more of a two-part problem.
There's the hardware side, which is the neurochemical,
which is the thing that philosophers and whatever seem to take issue with, which is if you build a brain one-to-one,
and then you show this simulated brain a picture of red,
and let's say it's mapped off an individual, will it have the same experience?
You show the two, the progenitor and the thing, the exact same red, will the same triggers happen?
I imagine if you build just a pure hardware copy, no, you probably get a bunch of nonsense garbage,
because we also have to be trained.
And that is an individual's experience.
But what I think you could do is, let's say you copied my brain precisely, you showed me red,
you then trained it on my response, then up to the point you could,
because in the same way that a neural network learns, this brain would be perfectly capable of learning one-to-one how I learn,
in the same way, like this is my brain.
And so let's say you can put it through a training regime of everything, every experience I have,
then I think what you would probably put, an assertion I would make is that then you could show it something new that I've never seen before,
and let's say you're able to plug into my brain and replay just that pathway, that software pathway,
that the experience that we experience would be within 99% of the same experience.
But, like, your brain is the way it is because once upon a time it was a smaller brain, it was a child brain,
and at certain points in time certain experiences affected your brain differently.
If they just recreated the end product and tried to train it on making one-to-one, or at least some sort of training to calculate your experiences,
I don't think it would be the same.
Because when you were a three-year-old, when your brain was developing certain experiences...
Okay, for the sake of the argument, let's say the second you're born a chip is plugged into your brain
that constantly streams every thought you have as a software relay to this machine,
and all the while it's your clone in a vat in case you die at your insurance company.
And so you die and it spits out your clone, and you're able to replay.
Is this the "are you you, you step into the teleporter" thing? That classic fucking personal?
If this brain is a sufficient physical corollary, it surely would actually be enough,
because assuming it accounts for the actual way the brain works in terms of things like neurons don't just fire,
they build up potential to fire, and then they may be fire.
Assuming that it accounts for all of the...
They actually fire spontaneously sometimes, too.
So, assuming we can account for the physical properties in whatever model we're using,
wouldn't it be analogous to how, like, as a chess game happens, you end up in the state you have
because of the previous moves, but if you take a snapshot of that state at any time,
that is the state you're in, like, regardless of whether we set it up or whether we follow the whole process there?
I think both could be valid, and we'll have to wait a century or two to see if that's true.
Well, this is with the assumption that it's all physical, but if it's all physical,
then ought not everything that got you there have had some physical consequence,
and that should exist as a property somewhere in that system.
It might, but let's say you've got all these nodes linking together, but node 1 can only be...
You can't emulate node 1 for some reason. We're struggling to figure out why,
and the why ends up being that that's actually a much more complicated process built up of childhood ones
that are no longer available to be replated in adult brain, like,
because you're past the point where you can blankly assemble this.
So even if you copy it one-to-one, it looks the same,
it's like we're intrinsically missing something, but maybe we look under the hood,
and you're like, "Oh, it's actually got all these pathways to other subs things that we just didn't recognize."
So it's the possibility that the level of detail we have now is not the sufficient level?
Yeah, that does bring it back, unfortunately, to a mechanical problem,
but in the same way, yeah.
Like cells in the body, right?
For example, even like cancer cells, you know, a random mutation, right?
That would create divergent paths, right?
So even if you replicate the brain 100%,
if there is some way to determine exactly at what point in what time this particular cell of billions mutates or something,
you're going to have...
Because your body is constantly changing.
That's another problem you can't make a perfectly physical copy. That's why I say 100%.
It can always be less than 100.
And so if there is an inherent chance in cell mutation, right?
We get cancer cells every day in our body, but our immune system has different ways of dealing with it.
But if it is just a random chance, you have to either determine that it is in fact not random,
that you can actually calculate which cell is going to be...
Based on what we did.
I will assert that in all likelihood it is not random,
because what randomness has meant so far in contemporary history for the last 70 years isn't actually random.
It means so complex that human beings cannot sufficiently compute it with anything we have.
So it seems likely that it is the result of factors,
it is just that we can't juggle all those factors to sufficiently compute the result.
I could be wrong about that. The fact that that can so far is the all likelihood answer.
A piece of hay bal.
So you are right in that, for example, if we can't compute things to a sufficient level of detail,
then yes, the simulation means nothing.
But with the assumption it is physical, and that you could somehow compute it,
with those assumptions made, then I think it should be sufficient.
But I do think it would be incredibly hard to prove random is not random.
Or prokaryotic life.
You know, like...
It is actually a philosophical problem as much as a scientific one.
So for example...
Sorry, I am interrupting you actually.
I should let you finish.
We have prokaryotic life, which is...
We have bacteria in a single cell,
and normally are supposed to eat each other.
But one went inside, didn't die, and then they...
Right.
That has never happened.
It only happened once in all of biological life as far as we know.
These two life forms existed for whoever knows how long.
Then there is just one instance of it happening.
Like...
Even if it is just in a perfect world, if we did have enough data to actually determine...
But I just don't think it would ever be possible to actually...
How would you know that you have got enough variables to be able to predict it?
Because often we think we have enough prokaryotic life to predict things,
and there is always more variables.
Yes, but...
You don't have to have a picture of the universe.
Or at least a sufficiently localized portion of it.
But then other parts of the universe are probably going to be having an...
They do, but there is this thing that we often forget about,
which is that different things have different degrees of effect,
and you can create models that are sufficient for certain purposes.
Depending on what you are trying to calculate, there is absolutely a not one-to-one model
that is still sufficient for the calculation you are trying to do,
unless the calculation you are trying to do is replicate the thing that you are making a model of.
Or, with possibly vast computing power,
you could probably simulate a universe, or so many universes.
We talked about this ages ago, about like...
If we had unlimited data, would we be able to know what some guy said,
like 10,000 years ago, in particular language?
It is a permutation problem. It is an information theory problem.
By calculating, going back through air flows and blah blah blah,
could we actually hear what...
It is that thing, the Tower of Babel, not the religious story, the digital one, where...
-Eye Babel. -Eye Babel.
-You could... -Those are the bad ones.
-They have milk in them. -They are glutenous though?
No, I don't think they are, but they do have milk in them.
Excellent are those ones. Original, so...
Double check the thing before you eat it, I am not sure, I am pretty sure.
-Yeah, this one says gluten-free. -Pretty sure all these things are gluten-free.
They are different brands.
-Pretty sure they are. -Cool.
Excellent.
-The Babel problem. -Oh yeah.
-Just... -Before you go on, get back to the thing.
After you are done, I do want to hear what you are going to say about it being a philosophical problem as much as a scientific problem.
No, okay.
No, you go first, because you were saying something.
I can't hear more.
You did? I didn't even remember.
-Go. -Alright, well...
So to some degree it is a philosophical problem as well, because...
And what is this problem we are talking about?
I am trying to recall exactly what I was saying.
I was buying myself five seconds at a time to come back to it.
But what exactly are we talking about here?
-Rent house randomization, even if we had a localized universe of study. -Oh, right.
So, sorry, thank you.
Now, none of this is definitively evidence that something can't exist.
But in terms of trying to explain how or why it would happen.
One of the problems we have with, say, free will and randomness, as opposed to fully deterministic systems,
is we understand the mechanisms of how a deterministic system works.
-It is very analogous to input-output. -Deterministic being...
This happens, we know we can predict this input-output, basically.
And over time, more and more things have been able to be pulled into that sort of realm, if you like.
We can explain more and more things.
We've done to randomness and the unpredictable what we sometimes argue is done to God,
like the God of the gaps over time.
What is explained by mythical phenomena is reduced over time.
It doesn't mean that everything will be explained, but that's the trend so far.
Randomness, in and of itself, we believe exists because we see what looks like randomness.
We see things we can't predict.
Yeah, pattern recognition is not...
If true randomness exists, it's possible we can never even explain how it works,
because it would be random. If we could explain it, it would be predictable.
But we have good reason to be provisionally suspicious of it, if that makes sense.
Where and how and why virtual particles spawn into existence
is probably the height of examples I could think of,
because everything else, I reckon, could be boiled down to determinism.
What about the programming function random?
Is there any way that you could know next time you press this button?
Yes, absolutely. That is entirely a constatative point.
It's hypothetically not.
The information is there, it's a processing problem.
We have access to the information, but whether or not we could calculate it is a pre-question, right?
Yeah, we're always talking in the area of, imagine you have infinite computing power.
Because we know that function is taking in very specific things to calculate that.
It's just taking variables.
So how random.org does it? Like the random number generator?
The background radiation.
Yeah, there's two ways. One does background radiation,
and they watch radio waves and frequencies and things like that,
that are just coming through the air, and that's their seeded key for the whole thing.
But imagine that you were the world's greatest astronomer with some incredible insights,
and you could predict what radio waves are going to hit Earth.
You could basically circumvent that system.
There's another one that uses like 40 lava lamps and the blobs as they float
to generate their seed key on like a CCTV footage with introduced artifacts and things like that.
Which, again, if you knew, if you were the god of liquid physics,
fluid dynamics, you might be able to reverse engineer that.
That one might break sooner, because fluid dynamics is more likely to be solved than the...
Yeah, I reckon if you trained a machine learning thing on that, on like lava lamps,
all day every day, it could be like, I know what the next...
I'm going to predict a key that's coming up, so I can beat you to your own system.
And yeah, there's possibly ways.
To say that I think this applies in nearly every possible domain in all of existence.
I don't think there's anything that escapes that.
If you have the information...
So you guys would say that the universe is deterministic?
The evidence points that direction.
I struggle to think of anything other than virtual particles.
As that we know of, that we can't even measure that.
Correct me if I'm wrong, Jayden, but you explain god then.
You wouldn't go so far as to say that we know for sure.
No, absolutely not.
We don't know anything about anything.
It just seems that on the balance of things, that's where everything has been heading.
It's a comfortable thought to think that everything's deterministic.
Based on our understanding of how the trend that we have been following,
it seems like we may be living in a deterministic universe.
It would be arrogant to say something like, "It's definitely going to turn out that it's all deterministic."
And this is how it is.
But one of the problems with the Say Free Will is it's very difficult to propose...
I find this a compelling argument.
It's difficult to propose a mechanism of how it could even work.
That doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but one of the problems with analyzing something like that is
every system we look at, at some level, even though this sounds reductive, boils down to
each thing has an effect on the other things.
But the moment you start describing any system that works that way,
which is so far every system we've come across in the history of ever,
aside from things that appear random,
you get a deterministic... you get a predictable result.
Even if you can't calculate it, you know that this affects this affects this in some way.
And if you could just hold that all in sync at the right moment, you could calculate the result.
Which means that free will becomes very difficult...
It doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but it becomes difficult to reason about and describe
because it doesn't seem to have any available mechanisms of action that aren't already claimed by determinism
that aren't also randomness.
Randomness is not free will.
Randomness also is, as I mentioned, a shrinking pool.
It could turn out something is truly random.
Even with particles, we should be very suspicious of the appearance of randomness.
It doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but...
Absolutely. They're probably deterministic as well.
There's probably something about the quantum foam of space,
contracting and expanding, that causes those things to happen.
And we're like, "Ah, that's the final piece. Everything makes sense. Everything is deterministic."
It seems like the unfortunate problem is you can only assume something is truly unknowable
if you've spent over a thousand years working on it with no progress.
We haven't actually hit that point with anything in our whole history.
At least not in the last two thousand years.
I'd love for this recording to some guy in a thousand years' time,
who picks it up and says, "These fucking caves, man. Look how fucking wrong they were about everything."
I hope so. That would mean that we've progressed.
Of course, all reasonable knowledge has to be provisional, right?
He mentioned that there are people who debate about something their whole lives.
Well, certainty doesn't exist.
Tell that to most people.
But you also have to do the best with what you've got.
If you feel like certainty doesn't exist so we shouldn't reason about it, then you don't go anywhere.
Yeah.
Are you sure about that?
Are you certain about that?
I provisionally believe it.
Isn't that a recent meme?
Are you sure about that?
Are you sure?
I've seen it on the TikToks and stuff.
Only Siths deal in absolutes.
Siths? I can't believe I committed to Siths.
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
Let's see.
Chistness is something fundamentally different than the material world.
That it exists on a level similar to gravity and space-time.
Therefore, it may not be something we can even study empirically.
That's where he starts to run into other problems, as we'll see.
It could be that consciousness is a language.
What?
Didn't he just say that gravity is in the realm of things we can't study empirically?
Yes.
That's not true.
That is well within the wheelhouse of what we attempt to study.
But does he mean gravity itself rather than...
Yeah, fundamentally what makes gravity or something?
Rather than what generates gravity?
...the effect it exerts on things?
I assume that's what he means.
I hope so.
Like, what is the origin of the fundamental forces?
Yeah, or like, what actually is gravity itself rather than...
...the effect it is exerting on something.
Well, gravity is the effect itself.
That's scientifically defined, that's all we care about.
Well, he's talking about the division between the science and the philosophers.
Playing into his game.
I think there's an underlying assumption he's got here of division that I don't want to be able to agree with.
So I'll try not to pull it up every time it keeps happening.
Yeah, I think a lot of his stuff would quickly be solved if he was like,
"Well, the person I'm talking about is one and the same."
Like, this philosopher is a scientist or vice versa.
Where did you find this fucking hack, Mike?
I didn't issue to Mike his transcripts, because I couldn't get the sound to play when I tried, on the website.
So I read the transcript. His transcripts are bonkers.
They're randomly capitalized.
That's like, whole words.
Like that fucking truly random...
I mean, there is some seeming logic to it, but then it goes out the window every now and then.
Can you go back like 15 seconds, so I can remember what the fuck we were talking about?
Gravity.
