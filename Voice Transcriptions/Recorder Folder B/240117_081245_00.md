to the Lex Fridman podcast, episode 130, where he's talking to Scott Alexander, sorry, not
Scott Alexander, Scott Aronson, the Complexity Zoo guy, and at about a minute, an hour and
24 minutes or so in, honestly, probably worth listening from an hour and 20 minutes, he's
talking about why P equals, equals or doesn't equals NP is the central problem, the most
important and central unsolved problem in computer science, what the practical applications
of it are, but most importantly for my purposes, that he says that he and a lot of, like probably
the majority of other mathematicians and computer scientists, mostly computer scientists, I
think, I think it's he's a computer scientist, I think he's mostly talking to computer scientists,
he and most other computer, and the majority of other computer scientists would bet their
money on P not equaling NP, which means that there's a whole class of problems that are
theoretically solvable, but are just unsolvable in practice, because of resource constraints,
which is actually really fucking important, and is a really good indicator that, and that
fact that he and most other, and a majority of other computer scientists would bet that
P doesn't equal NP is a very good indicator that for the complexity, the high level, like
the whatever word I want to use of complexity of our universe.
An interesting point, a little bit, slightly later he says that the chess, he uses the
chess example of, well basically the, it is, it's the chess example, as an example of a
P space problem, which is actually, P space is larger than NP, so P is contained within
NP, and NP is contained within P space, so NP and P are both subsets of P space problems,
which means that P equals NP is this, what the fuck are people doing, are this huge,
P versus P equals NP is this massive central thing in computer science, but the chess problem
is even beyond that, so yeah, complexity.
