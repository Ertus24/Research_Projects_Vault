listening to Philosophize This podcast episode 28 which is the first episode on 
Rene Descartes talking about the context in which he existed and what kind of what
the time period and what was happening and he's talking about kind of the
Protestant Reformation and the rise of you know the Scientific Revolution and
how all that stuff is kind of calling into question everything humanity is what
the Western culture has thought it never knew because everything was based on
you know the church and God and all of that shit and you know basically like a
thousand years or more an edifice of like a thousand years or more of
knowledge and the way things have run you know feudalism the way society has
run the way the economy is run you know when knowledge comes from all of that
stuff you know scholasticism all that shit just kind of comes crashing down
over a couple of centuries and humanity is left with basically like how the fuck
do we know anything yeah if the church was full of shit last time how can we
know that anything they say is right so it's basically the beginning of the
modern period and the modern period of philosophy is and I did from from the
last episode it sounds like quite heavily influenced by Francis Bacon and
Thomas Hobbes which then leads into Rene Descartes was basically like really that
that like take off of that of the period of searching for certainty like how like
basically be like well if all of that was bullshit how about we try and rebuild
all of our knowledge and stuff from the ground up again and do it this time we
do it with rationality we do it with chains of logical reasoning we start
from first principles we know that sure and we build up if that thing is the
case then we build up from there we know if that thing is the case based on that
we can say this thing and based on that we can say this thing it's the search
for a rational certainty and that obviously was happening previously but
this really seems to be when that when that takes off and and the problems that
come with that all of the interesting shit I'm interested in about about that
really kind of takes off there I think and then he goes on to talk about how
people like Francis Bacon in reaction to that these questions you know this this
good questioning and I like how do how can we know anything for sure we got we
know there was people who said we can't we can't know anything but then there
were people like Francis Bacon who said not only can we know things this
knowledge is will save humanity it is it is mankind's savior it will make
everything better for everyone and I think that's where
technicity and this this I this this stance this worldview of like progress
rational certainty and and scientific progress and technological progress say
like improving a lot successively to the point where it saves us it delivers us
from all evils all world the evils that it really seems to take off at this point
so that's basically the project of modernity which is why you then get the
postmodern you know and like from Nietzsche onwards Nietzsche and every
the people he's reacting to kind of Nietzsche onwards reacting against that
being questioning all of that that that certainty and being like maybe
everything's relative and you're leading into postmodernism and all that kind of
stuff which is why you then get you know this kind of almost war in some ways it
may be a cultural but almost this war we have now between the people who are
trying to hold on to them that modernist you know reaching searching for rational
certainty to try and solve all problems and progress and all that and the other
side of the continuum to the other side which is complete relativism and
everything's well everything's relative and there's no certainty about anything
which is in some ways they're like Jordan Peterson versus the SGW's kind of like
in some ways boiled down simplified so in a bunch of ways the some of the deep
cultural problems we're facing you know the stuff that is is exploding at the
moment is in some ways like a the latest and in some ways most vicious
expression of that of that project of modernity it's also this period of in
the beginning of modernity and modernism with Francis Hogue Francis
Bacon and Descartes and Francis Bacon and then Hobbes and then Descartes that
leads that is the period where the rupture between rationalism and
empiricist and empiricism arise and I think that gets kind of resolved in some
ways with Kant it kind of it that rupture goes on for years and then
kind of Kant kind of synthesizes those two things and now we are kind of living
in the post-Kantian world we're living in the whatever the result of Kant is
