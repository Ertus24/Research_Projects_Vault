Things to remember. The wheels are, sorry, actually yes, one of the two wheels on the
driver's side sound like they might have something in them. That might even just be a stone,
but it's been going for a little bit now. I thought if it was a stone it would have
come out. So maybe check the wheels. The brakes are squeaking a little bit. Sometimes. And
there was another thing. I don't have the service book on me. Am I able to bring it
back in to get it stamped because I want to, I'm going to sell the car soon. Basically
am I able to bring the service book back in later. I had a different time and date to
get it stamped. There was a third thing. I don't remember what it was. That might have
been the third thing. There was definitely three things. Maybe that was the third. I
feel like the third one was one about the car itself. Yeah, that's another thing. The
front right, I guess the nozzle that the water comes out of when you do the windscreen wipers.
The right of those two, the one that's in front of the driver's seat doesn't seem to
be working.
