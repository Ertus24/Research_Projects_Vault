I'm not going to talk about it here because I just want to listen to it, but just as a
note come back and listen to from 33 minutes and 30 seconds onwards in episode 7 of After
Socrates because he starts talking about Ian McGill-Crisp's work in Mastering His Emissary
with about the hemispheric differences. And that's a really central point for me.
