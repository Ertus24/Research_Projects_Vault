YouTube video called "Why Do Movies Feel So Different Now?"
and he's talking about, he's going through modernism, postmodernism and
metamodernism in
uh... movies
and it's making me realize that a lot of the ways I'm thinking about relationships and
emotions
is pointing towards metamodernism
because it's this like
accepting that yes things are shit
and horrible
but there is still sincerity and beauty
amongst it all, it's not all deconstruction
you know how I'm feeling, how I'm approaching
relationships at the moment
or what I want out of relationships
seems to have an element of the metamodern about it
I feel like I myself am moving in the metamodern direction
you know it's not just
um...
it's not just
modernism of, you know we have this
rationalism
sides will fix everything, it's not just postmodernism where it's you know
nothing matters, nothing means anything
it's completely deconstructed to you know
no
it's like a you know, no
no emotions
yeah I'm not quite sure what I'm pointing to here
but there's definitely a sense going through this
watch that video again
that's especially the bit where he starts talking about metamodernism, that's where this inside happened
