I'm not sure if I already made a thing for this, but I don't want to talk about it all, I just want to listen to it.
But from 34 minutes onwards, or a little bit before that onwards, in episode 7, "A Dimonion" of After Socrates,
he starts talking about the relation, um, in McGill-Crest work with the hemispheres,
and how the left hemisphere is basically evolved to deal with well-defined problems,
and the right hemisphere is evolved to deal with ill-defined problems.
