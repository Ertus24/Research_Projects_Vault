Listening to episode 27 of "awaiting for the meaning crisis" again. I'm at
Almost exactly 20 minutes in and he's talking about rationality not as logic but as
Knowing when where and how to use logic and here's what he says
You more that being rational is not just the second technology of logic
But other second technologies knowing how knowing where when and how to use them in order
There to overcome self-deception
It's not rationality isn't just using the psychotechnology of logic
It's using the psychotechnology of what it's it's
knowing when where and how to use
Psychotechnology of logic and other
psychotechnologies in order to
avoid self-deception
That's actually exactly what?
That's almost exactly what?
David Chapman calls meta rationality. I
think
Basically John David Chapman is equating rationality with
basically logic logic formalization
formalization and
John Vivek is saying that basically rationality is
Actually David Chapman's a meta rationality it is
It's the ability to see through different
Psychotechnologies through different
You know system lot logics and systems and things like that
and
Knowing when to use them where to use them how to like knowing how to use them
But knowing to what degree to use them in different at different times in different contexts
Which is matter of basically meta rationality. It's it's the
swimming it's the
Navigating the seas of complexity through
the
Through the right vehicle for the right
moment basically
Yeah, that's actually really interesting
So they are I think essentially talking about the same thing they're just using different terms. Oh
Such a cute dog eyes
Yeah, they're actually I think I said she talking about the same thing they're just talking about it differently in different ways
But I think I think I'll basically they're both trying to push everyone people towards
They're both trying to push people towards meta rationality
Yeah interesting
Which is
Kind of just adds further fuel to the fire of my interest in meta rationality
Yeah, and then a couple seconds later. He says often when he's talking about rationality people think he's talking about logic and consistency
Which he isn't
And that's I mean that's pretty much the heart of of
David Chapman's
Made David Chapman's rationality logic and consistency. I'm pretty sure he actually even defines
Assisted like systems as you know a consistent set of rules
I've got to go look at that without how David Chapman defines a system, but I'm pretty sure he outlines it as like a
consistent set of rules because it's it's using reason and
rationality to arrive at
Reasons for doing things
consistent like being consistent having consistent reasons for doing things having consistent evidence following a
Process all of that kind of stuff
When I'm writing about the whole
That we're inherently biased and flawed and but that's okay because we need that
That part of what I'm trying to write. I should pretty much just listen to you
the first half hour of 20 of
Episode 27 are waiting for the meeting crisis like on repeat
Basically, it's kind of what I'm doing. But
Yeah
There's so much insight in here. This is a really good summary of of the point. He says
you know explains what heuristics are what they do how they they they prejudge they've they they
Get us to pre judge what's going to be relevant and therefore our source of bias and he says
This is unavoidable. You have to use heuristics to avoid combinatorial explosion. You can't be comprehensively logical
And the price you pay for avoiding combinatorial explosion is that you fall prey to bias again and again and again
back to the very things that make us adaptive other things very other very things that make us adaptive other things that
Make us prone to self-deception
Which is what?
Rationality is trying to overcome
John Vivek's rationality slash
David Chapman's meta rationality, I think
He's trying to overcome that
that bias that
Necessarily bias nature
Because it's trying to overcome self-deception and then that's the self-deception that is baked into our experience because of
What we how we need to be to deal with the
the unbounded complexity of reality
This makes it really
So much of what I was learning in in
psychology and behavioral and like the behavioral economic stuff and all the heuristic stuff is
It's such an interesting like a different lens on it. You know, and the fact that you so many economists are I
think it's why I got so heavily turned off from economics, but
Yeah, they see these things as problems that we are
You know these heuristics where they see they see them as ways in which we fall short of rationality and
by that they're equating it with logic logic basically with
Using logic to arrive at certainty about or like good reasons for doing things
And economics has has used that as the basis of its
Arguments with it without paying attention to the ways in which
We are we we do use heuristics and we need to use heuristics and that's okay and important
Really makes me want to read that rationality debate thing that John Faveke
Him and a couple other people wrote a paper on it like the rationality walls or something like that
Yeah, and it definitely puts a different spin on
What stuff people like evident and doing where they're you know, they are they're using and
The behavior change which actually makes me think that maybe baby change is still somewhere worth going for me
That
You know that it it it leans on heuristics a lot
to try to understand heuristics in the ways in which we
fall prey to them
and
Bias and stuff in order to understanding those things in order to change people's behavior, but I think maybe that
That could be better done as well. Perhaps by understanding that this fact that you know, it's not a way that we're falling short
Because we're this with that's falling short of a standard that is impossible like literally impossible and
ridiculous and it's actually
miraculous and
Like the ability to you to I'll know the heuristics actually make us fucking incredible
basically
They are strength
They are how we function basically
And I think it's like I don't know how you'd like empirically study this but
some empirical evidence of
You know the ways in which they actually benefit us would be interesting
Yeah
Yeah, and this this makes me feel like maybe I'm really like maybe I am on the right path
Even doing the behavior change stuff. I was on the right path. Maybe maybe that is what I want to get into still
it's just I need to take this time to
really dive into my
This philosophical stuff around this and you know start writing maybe get a book do a blog do LinkedIn post whatever and
I'm not
That should become known but you know if I am
Applying for jobs, it would be interesting to be like behavior change jobs would be interesting be like well
Here's my view on things
And you can and you can read all about them in my in my blog and the ways in which
Yeah, so I
Feel like I'm like actually in the right place. I'm doing I'm if I can if I can get some real momentum with this
To the point where it becomes self-sustaining and it kind of replaces
games as
The thing that I I just kind of tend towards doing
So that I don't have to worry about at the moment
I'm in this early stage where I'm fixated on constantly trying to do it
I'm filled with pressure to constantly try to do it because I've never done it before and I know that if I don't jump
On it it the momentum will fade and I'll go back to feeling purposeless and lost and sitting around playing games
Or like not even doing that because I'm not enjoying that
Whereas this is the opposite of that and I want to get to a point where I don't have to have that
I can just you know know that I will do it
when the time is available and
You know it and it's okay that like I'd like to get to a point where I can be like well
I'm just gonna sit down and watch game videos to like a thing tonight. I'll watch a movie tonight because I
Know that tomorrow. I'm gonna do a bit of this writing kind of stuff
And I really I really want to
In so many ways I want to I don't want to say oh
I'm thinking about working on a blog anymore
I'm interested in philosophy and I'm thinking about starting writing or saying to people like I you know
I kind of write about philosophy a bit and then there's not actually anything there because that's what I've you know
Oh, I volunteer on the farm and I've done it twice
Oh, I do this that the other and I've actually done it once or twice
I really want to do this for its own sake but also because I want to be able to be like I
Do this and here it is go have a look
You know and I can show that to employers I can I can share that with other people
It's forcing me to be vulnerable all those things
I really want to get to that point and that's probably gonna take a while because I actually find
This part of it the thinking and the note-taking fine and actually really interesting
It's the actual writing it's I have the same problem writing as I did writing essays at university
It feels like smacking my head against the wall and actually really don't particularly enjoy it a lot of the time
But I think this might be a little bit different potentially
Yeah
Yeah, so
Yeah
So then another couple of seconds later he talks about how
You know you use heuristics
Because you can't calculate all the probabilities and that's the important point that
Economics your rationalist systems like economics don't see or they didn't see this time to see it a bit now
They didn't see we are
Holding people to this standard of assuming that people just are doing this and also holding us to this standard of rationality of
Logic really well that you know that we're calculating all the probabilities and we're doing the cost-benefit analyses and all that kind of stuff
You don't actually do that. You don't do a cost-benefit analysis
Probably even like subconsciously you're not doing a cost-benefit analysis
You just know
You just intelligently focus on this on on
Things jump out to you as what you should pay attention to so actually this is like deeply relevant to
Economics and the whole way that we think about ourselves
and
How people do things I think this drastically changes that and it's so fucking vital
This only are these these ideas and it's because it's also so challenging to our sense of to our
ideas around
Agency and individual and and the individual
You know we have these ideas that you can control your thoughts in your and your beliefs and your emotions and stuff
But so much of this stuff we don't control and this is saying I care about a lot so much of this stuff
We don't control
You know, we don't make decisions things happen to us
Or we just like intelligently
you know know what to do or don't know what to do and our ways of talking about these things are
actually damaging because they don't
Represent reality in a lot of ways in a lot of ways very many ways
They don't represent reality at all, which is actually really damaging to us
And this is something I care about really deeply challenging ideas around selfhood and individuality and
What come and the things that come with that like?
How we talk about emotions how we talk about
Responsibility how we talk about decisions we talk about many many things
comes from a
ill a
Inaccurate
Idea around the self which is I think in a lot of ways the
And that's wrapped up in ideas of standards of rationality and
Well, and you see that even Ryan talking about the way he thinks that we make decisions and stuff. That's
All of this stuff is vitally important to our everyday lives
And I want to push back against so much of what I see so often and the way we talk about things
Like you don't
You don't work that way
This is where I really this is where I want to get to in my
writing basically I want to tile look because all of these things tie together in my worldview and I want to I want to
tie all these things together and and
You know be able to talk to other people about this
Because I want to talk to other people about this and you and like no
This is you know
This is why I think you're you're wrong when you when you're when you see things in a certain way
Or when people say just in everyday life people say things a particular aim from that kind of
Perspective I want to be like no
I'm pushing back against that. I don't think that's where
And here's why and here's a large list of reasons as to why I think that's the case and
John Vivek is work is actually fucking central to that
Relevance realization is central to that and this idea of that. We're not like we're not comprehensively logical
we don't calculate probabilities because things are just far too far vastly too complex and
Yeah, and we've got this view, you know and like the computational theory of mind kind of is like related to that stuff
You know, we've got this view of you know
AI is gonna be a solve all our problems because it will be able to just do all those things
It will be able to just
calculate every probability
So it can't be rational for us
I just I don't think any of those things are true because all of this buts up against what we haven't accepted that
the universe is vastly more complex than we think it is and
We are actually incredibly adept at navigating it we just don't think we are which comes back to the you know
giving respect to
reasonableness
Respecting and
Actually not denigrating
Most of the ways that we do things because they're actually incredible you more accepting and understanding of the price we pay for those things
It's understandable that we don't because we have a long history. We have very long history of basically being like
Fuck emotions rationality is what matters
Even though it's not just emotions
It's people making bad decisions etc. Etc but that comes with
What how we need to be to deal with the complexity of the universe?
Yeah, realize my stuff about me and the skepticism I feel about
AI and all that kind of stuff
Because I think this stuff this all of this this cluster of ideas
challenges all of that heavily a
Few seconds later literally getting like a second at a time here a few seconds later. He talks about how
Newell and Simon are basically saying that part of what makes us intelligent is our ability to use heuristics
And that's
But I feel like that's maybe not really how it's seen it's often actually seen as
Heuristics are us being almost stupid basically
And this makes me think about how you know, this is all time back to
David Chapman's how he talks about rationality and reasonableness
You know that we were reasonable most of times a rationality is actually not how we actually are or the state
It's not the same we should be aiming for it's actually like just kind of like a
specialized outgrowth of reasonableness
That you only use in specific circumstances, and it doesn't quite work the way we think it does
And we need to stop treating it like we do basically I
Actually think I mean this is I don't think I think this is actually in what?
Many ways what John Vavek is actually saying and what David Chapman saying, but I think this these ways that we see
the individual and the person and
Rationality and it's like this way that we have historically and still affected by now state seen human beings as rational creatures
Rational in the in the other sense of logical and consistent
This this kind of worldview that that
What this will be that I am pushing back against with my all my thoughts here
Everything I've just outlined here basically that that kind of traditional way of seeing things you know that homo economicus
Rationalicus
Way of seeing things is actually I think a large contributor to the meaning crisis
I think I think it's actually in a lot of ways what John Vavek is saying
Because it's not
Representative it's not doesn't represent. That's not how things actually are for one so it's you know
Turning us trying to turn us into something we're not
But also
Yeah, I'm not quite sure why else I think that why do I think that that this is contributing to the meaning crisis
Maybe because of what I don't know David Chapman talks about it because like you know the meaninglessness that comes with logic
The like the semantic
you know a lot of a lot of logic is about
it utilizes the power of
Meaninglessness in the sense of like no semantic content
Logic doesn't a lot of most of time doesn't care about it. It's it's aiming for the abstract the general the
The universal
And it's often meaningless because it wants to because it's
abstract general etc etc it wants to
Work in terms of things that it wants to be a play be able to be universal applied anywhere
But that's not really how meaning works most
Maybe meanings more complex in this and it there is instances in which it is like that, but most mean most of meaning
Occurs in a context within a situation
in relationships between things
So it's maybe like this emphasis on rash on logical rationality
And that and you know and holding us to that standard and assuming that that's how we actually work
And you know the things that come with you know that we are isolated individuals
You know that's wrapped up in the eye in can't eat the contian the day car to can't eat an isolated individual thing
that where these rational isolated individuals that
What we are is thinking thing that
is rational and
Uses rationality to navigate the world
Is holding us to the standard of logic and science and mathematics which is largely meaningless
But that's not actually how we work
We are we exist in a world of meaning
We are drenched our worlds are actually despite how it often feels our worlds are drenched in meaning because it gets drained of meaning by
This worldview that we have
this hyper rationalist worldview
Hyperlogical worldview
You know the scientific worldview basically
And this is a general pattern there's ways in which this isn't true
There's ways in which this falls short this way there's things I don't know that I can you know the relationship between logic and science
I can't really speak to
This is a general pattern. I see and it may not hold true all the time in all instances
I may have a just it may just be completely wrong, but I I get the sense that there is some definitely some
level of truth of
representative to
Presentativeness of reality in what I am saying here, and that's actually why I care so I think so much about pushing back against the Silicon Valley
worldview against
The techno technologists though less wrong than rationalist the
Jaden Jane's point of view the
The
There's some other things I wanted to talk to say there, but you know this this this
Worldview that's almost dominating the world I think
hyperrationalist
hyperlogical
You know AI will solve all problems technology and progress will solve all problems
Yeah
Yeah, that's why I can't you know the computational theory of mind all of that
It's all kind of related to it to each other, and I that's why I care so much about pushing back against all of that
Because it is really damaging because
That doesn't represent
That's not how we actually work because it's wrapped up in you know abstract in general and meaninglessness and all of that kind of stuff
and
And there's important ways in which this is wrong, but it's worth exploring anyway even if people have critiques of it I
Think
And this and and and like the I guess the opposite of this or you know and
This worldview where things are
You know that pushing towards the abstract in the general and the scientific and the logical and this hyper rationalist worldview
What John what David Chapman talks about is the opposite of that that our world is actually drenched in meaning we exist in a sea
Of meaning we constantly and navigating it and that meaning exists like like he's like he's talking about
in his
Yeah, I don't know maybe it's just his introduction holy shit
Wow
That thing is actually smoking oh no that was smoked from the from the thing it's fine
We actually
Meanings are everywhere. It's just that they often feel
They feel trivial a lot of the meanings we we we don't see them or we think that they're meaningless because they feel
Trivial, but they're still there meaning is everywhere all around us all the time
and it's by rather than he's talking about rather than searching for these like
universal transcendental
transcendent meanings
like you know the meaning of life and and
Per the yeah, these massive purposes and stuff
We need to see the meaning that we need to really see and focus on the meaning that's around us all the time
Because it's there
It may not be
We ache for transcendent meaning
Greater meaning
But it may not be there
But what is there is the meaning that is around us all the time and we should
focusing on those and you know what he talks about and what his wife talks about or his partner talks about
is
really
Focusing on that meaning
And and you know, it's it's almost like a method to
To see and focus on the meanings that are actually there and see them for what for the for the wondrous things they actually are
because in your end it then brings
creativity and and openness and
Yeah, the opening awareness thing that you talk about
Um
Yeah
Wow god so many fucking bangers at the moment. It's hard to like it's gonna be hard to synthesize all of this stuff, but
I feel like i'm hitting a new point of a new level of
Bringing things together and sophistication I guess
I've had a lot of I kind of like vague ideas banging around and now this is forcing me to bring them all together a bit more
Um until I really start really start writing this stuff down and working on it and working and actually working it out
It's just it's going to remain like i'm not going to be able to express it to other people
but
Yeah, things I feels like things are starting to come together. I'm really getting a very cohesive
worldview and set of ideas and points that follow that are that
Are supported by that worldview and things that I care about and why I care about them and and maybe even some direction like
What I want to focus on
through explicating this stuff
Man, this is fucking amazing. Some ways I think I have holly to thank for this
Because I didn't like I never really talked to her about any of this stuff, but the me
here now the me that
loves reading in the way that I do that loves
thoughts and thinking and you know diving into books and um
Diving into books and you know taking notes and things
That arose with her
That that me
Came into being in the relationship with her and I'd it feels like and maybe it would have but it feels like in a lot
Of ways it that me wouldn't have come about without her
Um, and I love this I kind of love this version of me
So i've just been listening to this episode this again this recording and I got up to about six minutes in where I was talking about
That
rationality
Basically the six minute mark of this and it made me realize that I mean it's kind of what I already said
but it made me realize that
Rationality
Both metarationally, but also honestly even rationality and the scientific method and all those kinds of things
Psychotechnologies that we develop to overcome our own
to enhance our our abilities to to overcome the
downsides we we have to deal with
Because of our need to use heuristics to deal with cause
Um combinatorial explosion we
We developed these
As ways to
Enhance our abilities even further basically like our abilities honestly are already pretty incredible
Through reasonableness and and heuristics and we developed rationality and are developing metarationality as ways to
take that even further by
Overcoming those biases that are like so we can get the the upsides and
through those methods
Not have the downsides as much
Which is you know shows how fucking powerful they are
Problem comes when we see them as the only viable way
to arrive at knowledge
The only
Legitimate when they replace everything else kind of thing
Um listing some more and got some more thoughts. I got up to about the nine minute mark just before no
It's about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so and I was talking about um, basically I realized that
What that essay I did or the sorry the presentation I did in my first semester of my honours about
The not the essay but the the in the seminar class the presentation I did that you know statistical learning
paper
that is in some ways a
And what they were talking about there is in some ways a
Um
An empirical demonstration of
The strengths of our biases because statistical learning is
basically
It appears that statistical learning biases us
Emphasis on the word bias. It's a heuristic. It's it gets us to prejudge what's important
Bias this biases us towards
regularities because
There are regularities all over the place and we benefit from being able to focus on them
And that this actually may be involved in the way that we um
This may be involved in the way that we actually acquire language as children
so actually that's
statistical learning
And the and that thing around attention and I wonder if there's anything that's come further from that
uh is actually quite good empirical evidence for the power of
um
Power of using heuristics, but also
further evidence that we of of it's it's it's something I can use to to point at
point to
The fact that we do use heuristics and we do that because of the uncounted the unbounded complexity of reality
you know
The whole reason we have to do that is because there is so much information around us all the fucking time
Constantly we are constantly being bombarded with a an enormous amount of
information
And
You know, it's like it is a combinatorially explosive amount of information and if we had to
um, you know, it's it's further evidence that we
Um
It is further evidence that we
Uh
Need that we use heuristics in order to deal with complexity
So it's for it's it's another thing on top of what john vivecki talks about
it's another piece of evidence I can use to point to
um
To give an example as to why uh further evidence I can use to point to
Reality being infinitely complex
um
And that we have to use heuristics and buy and we have to use heuristics that bias us in order to
Deal with that
I've just gotten up to about 16 minutes and 40 seconds in
Where i'm kind of railing against, you know saying we don't work that way
um
It made me realize
um, so i've i've thought new thoughts to talk about
Um if I can fucking hold on to it we don't work that way, uh
Rational uh
Economics for a very very long time for most of its history has assumed that we do
that the way that we exist and the way that we function is by
is through rationality that we we are
at base logical and that we
Um
That we
economics assumes that we are logical creatures were rational creatures and we
You know, we do cost benefit analyses all of that kind of stuff
and that's actually
deeply damaging because economics has so much fucking sway
In the world
And its core like it's most some of its most core assumptions are deeply
deeply wrong
Um
And i'm not quite sure
to what extent that actually affects the world, but I
Definitely have a sense that it does deeply affect the world
and and I and I
I remember when I was reading about economics before I started getting into this stuff when I was reading about economics and
uh, you know that you know back in like 2018 2019 when I was reading about economics and starting to read about like the
unorthodoxy unorthodox
economics, uh like you know don't know economics and the stuff that's you know, uh
growth and all that kind of shit all of that is a push back against
the
Orthodox economic way of seeing things which is based heavily on
This kind of rationalist enlightenment view of the world of the world and of people as isolated
rational individuals
Isolated selfish rational individuals which actually a lot that underlies
Capitalism so much that underlies capitalism that underst- underlies economics that underlies our politics in a ways
our we are governed and all of that is based on
deeply
Unrealistic deeply damaging and i'm not quite sure why it's damaging but I
Don't know but I have a very strong sense that it is
It is damaging
precisely because it's not it's
It doesn't it doesn't it's unrealistic it doesn't match our own reality and how we actually
Function how we actually exist and how we experience our lives which means that so much of the way that our world is structured
our economics our
economic systems
Our governmental systems are not structured
They are not structured around human beings
They're not structured around or for humans because they're based on
Very faulty ideas of humans and how they work and how they experience the world and what they are
Which means I think this stuff that I'm interested in is like directly pushing back against
some of the deepest issues facing our society like
problems with some of the problems with capitalism driven by profit motive and
you know which is driven by the religion of progress and
This
deeply rooted idea of
humans as
self-interested
isolated
Rational thinking individuals, but that's what we are that that the deepest level
So even more so this this worldview stuff
I'm trying to explore and it lay out also maybe directly leads me on to ways in which and
And gives me even more reason to care about these things that I care about because they're directly pushing back against
So many of the problems I see in the world
It just feels like even more
Even more evidence that this is the right path to go on even though I don't know where it's leading
I don't know what it means
All I know like all I can sense is that this just seems
So many things are coming together
this feels like I am bringing together the last five or six years of
Thought is starting to to congeal and synthesize
Together here in so many different ways in very fucking powerful ways
And I'm so fucking excited
