I just had another thought about this whole, like, "complexification versus simplification,"
"openness versus closeness" dynamic, um, and how I was saying earlier today, you know,
recording I did earlier today about how I, you know, for a long time I've been, I've
struggled with the way that people, um, tend towards simplicity, that people tend to simplify
things, um, they tend to, towards wanting certainty, they tend towards, you know, locking
in on a certain way of seeing a world or a way of understanding things, and, um, being
blind to others in the process, and, and the way, what that leads to, and the way that
people, you know, talk to each other and the discourse, the way, you know, where discourse
is going, and all the problems that leads to that I've struggled with my whole fucking
life. Um, but, also, at the same time thinking about it, um, I've been thinking about it
for a long time, um, you know, if, if this, if I am, if my hunch is right, and this simplific,
this tendency towards simplification arises from the having mode, from the left hemisphere,
from the need to understand the environment and control it, you know, in order to furnish
our, the things we need for survival, um, you know, that ability to manipulate and control
and understand, if that is linked to the simplification process, it's also like, you know, if it is
the case that most people tend towards that and there's maybe a rare few that tend, that
push back the other way, um, that's quite understandable, because the vast majority of,
like, the vast majority of people are just trying to survive. Most people are just trying
to fucking get by in life, you know, so of course they're gonna be wrapped up in this,
um, solid, you know, this, this way of thinking, this way of being that, um, a way of being,
I think a better way of thinking about it than thinking, because there's a lot of ways
of things we do that aren't thinking that are still to do with this, this way of being,
this existential mode, as Johnny Vee would say, is wrapped up in, um, uh, survival, and
the vast majority of us, for the vast majority of existence, have, are just trying to fucking
survive. So of course we don't have time, so of course we don't have time to question
our assumptions about things, if you're just trying to get food on the plate, if you're
just struggling to survive, if you just, you know, your life is, like most of us, life is
just spent working to feed yourself and your family, you don't really have the fucking
time or capacity or resources or inclination to, um, to question your assumptions, to push
back the other way and seek the open, you know, um, and in some ways it's also like
that in those instances, doing that would actually be a fucking bad idea, because you've
only got limited resources, and the whole bioeconomy thing that Johnny Vee talks about
that underlies resource, that underlies, um, uh, bioeconomy that underlies relevance realization,
you have limited resources and time, and if most of your resources, you know, if your
resources, so much of your, many of your resources are taken up by, um, putting food on the table,
being in survival mode, spending any spare resources you've got doing something that's
going to make that more difficult, is maybe not actually a good idea, so actually for
the vast majority of people, for a lot of people, this is maybe not only, it's maybe
a necessary way to be, particularly in the fucking environment that we find ourselves
in, you know, this might be a reason that all of the great philosophers weren't fucking
peasants, because they had the time and resources to think about shit, to question, you know,
the philosophers of ancient Greece were usually, very often, fucking nobles or, you know, almost
always men, they weren't women, that's the important point, almost always they weren't
women because women were spending all of their time fucking looking after the household and
the family, they had no fucking spare resources, so, you know, yeah, maybe I need to cut people
a bit more slack, basically, you know, now we're stuck in this hyper distracted hyper
productivity hyper speed accelerationist fucking last bubble, questioning assumptions is the
last fucking thing on most people, most people barely have the energy to go to work, come
home and clap on the fucking couch, which really is what there is for most of us, which
I fucking hate, and maybe I need to accept that and just accept that I may never really,
if I want to do the things I want to do, that may come at the price of worldly success and
quite possibly comfort, may come at the cost of comfort.
Whoops didn't mean to add to this one.
