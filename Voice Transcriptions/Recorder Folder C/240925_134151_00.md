So it's the next day, my second day back, the Wednesday.
And the feelings I was talking about yesterday did not last.
I am back to feeling, not quite, not like scornful or anything, but I'm back to feeling
bad, I guess.
I'm not like appreciating the weather and the sunlight.
I'm back to feeling...
I don't really know what the feeling is, it's not...
It's not whatever I was feeling yesterday.
I'm not feeling happy to be back and I'm not appreciating things like I was yesterday.
And I am feeling...
I'm missing Melbourne.
I'm missing...
I don't know if I'm missing Holly, but I'm sad.
I'm sad that Melbourne is over.
I'm sad that, in some ways I'm sad, I'm thinking of Holly and our past relationship a bunch.
I'm sad about that.
And that the end of these, that this being over, Melbourne being over, means Holly and
I are still friends, but our relationship is over and is not going to happen again.
Which I know is a good thing.
But I'm sad about it at the moment.
And I just feel blah today.
And all the positive things I was feeling yesterday about being in Brisbane are gone.
I'm not really feeling bad about being in Brisbane, but it just feels like a place.
It's just a place where I am right now.
