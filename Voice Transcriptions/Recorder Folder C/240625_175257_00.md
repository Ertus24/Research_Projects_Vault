You're more likely to have.
So, you know, maybe actually things like.
Things like.
Plasma guns aren't actually their native AP actually isn't enough to just straight up reduce just completely ignore space Marines armor.
Maybe what they do have is.
High.
Like a high rendering value so that they.
So that space Marines and shit still get their save.
But yeah, I don't know.
Depends on how tough you want those guys to be.
