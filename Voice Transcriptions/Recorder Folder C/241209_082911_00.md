Episode 217 of "Philosophize This" at the moment. It is
Episode on Nishitani and his book "Religion and Nothingness"
And he's gotten up to
At about 20 minutes in give or take it's probably actually more like 18-19 minutes
He's talking about how
Nishitani
Sees these kind of three existential standpoints
from which we
Cut quite not quite sure how he puts it like how we how we relate to ourselves and the world around us kind of thing
and they are
those six those standpoints are
consciousness
nihility and
Shinata and he says like a true religious
Engagement is about is generally a quest where we move from consciousness through nihility to
Shinata
And he talks about how and consciousness is what we spend most of our time in and consciousness is
Sounds very similar to that cluster of things the left hemisphere
Propositional tyranny all that kind of stuff
It's
Representational it's where we relate to ourselves as a subject to surrounded by a world of objects that we're trying to control
It's the dualistic thinking
All of that stuff that's all very left hemisphere sounding
Yeah
So he gets onto this by talking about how most the most people's relationship with the religion is very shallow and
Is actually a way to kind of rather than
What a true religious quest should be which is kind of being opened like opening ourselves to the world emptying the self and
kind of coming to realize the
the fundamental
Lack like that the lack of distance or control the
the there's no
We are fundamentally part of real
I can't be I'm not quite sure but then he talks about how a lot of people's religious experience is very shallow and is the
Opposite of that is more about projecting ourselves onto the world in order to understand and control it
And
And that
This has been the case for a long time in the West and that this
relates to that that consciousness
that like that way of
the way you
Often the way people experience religion actually gets in the way of a true religious experience
Through this kind of consciousness standpoint that he's talking about but that that quest from consciousness through neality to
Sitchinata he says results in removing the illusion of our separation from being
Consciousness is where we project ourselves onto the world and try to control it all interesting
so he talks about in this consciousness we
Which we reify objects we take something that has no fixed durable meaning and we try to turn it into something that does
Have fixed a durable meaning so that we can use it for our purposes
and to in order to reify to
To kind of pin down these things we have to smuggle in
Stuff like platonic forms or essences or things like that in and that's what we've done in in the Western tradition
muggle in
Meaning as it's supposedly given to us by some
Eternal external God which it sounds like David Chapman's
eternalism
This is the field of awareness where we
Create these elaborate theories about how subjects relate to objects
For
Utilitarian purposes or something like that and so he talks about how this this this consciousness
awareness state of awareness is constantly
distracting us
from
the deeper religious experience
And he says if you're not engaging with nihilism
Fully then you will never then you'll never kind of get past this
consciousness
Experience so if we're not engaging with nihilism we will always be stuck in this consciousness
Which the state of awareness which means we will always be at a distance from the immediate relationship we have with being thing
So consciousness becomes about just projecting our ego onto the world and he says
The
The most of Western philosophy has taken place within this field of consciousness, this is an important point
He
See says yeah like the history of Western philosophy is basically and almost entirely occurred within this this
Consciousness framework
Field or whatever you want to call it, but this tiny isn't saying that's that that's bad
He's not saying consciousness is bad, and we need to get rid of it. It's not a dualistic thing
And he says there's a lot that Western philosophy has done has done a lot. We've gotten a lot out of consciousness. We have these
Powerful systems and etc etc etc
I
Think yet the important point there is that it's not that consciousness is bad, and we need to get rid of it
It is one
possible aspect
said
He says you know he straight-up says
Nishitani
acknowledges that we need the
Consciousness field sometimes
It's just that to neglect the others and spend your entire life living in the consciousness field would mean that you're spending your entire life
relating to the world as something to control
Which is the left hemisphere?
Which is the having mode?
That's the whole thing we've been you know we've gotten stuck into
The we've gotten stuck in the having mode
existential
confusion modal confusion, I think is the term
John for fake he uses so he says you know so like a Nietzsche might night Nietzsche might say that
We know we create meaning at the level of the self
which is you know basically at the level so Nietzsche basically works in the level of the consciousness and
You know that we we create values for ourselves
He says but that there's there's criticisms of critiques of Nietzsche that say that he doesn't he
Over-privileges the individual and doesn't pay attention to anything else
and
Nishitani is basically coming in and so so Nietzsche
What's it what he affirms?
Life through the lens of the individual, but the Nishitani is coming in and affirming life through all of the fields or the other fields
Maybe there's others he
All the fields that he can see
He's saying the truly religious transformation is going to be to take this individual self from the field of consciousness
And to liberate it to understand the groundless ground that what we call the self
We rest upon and then to expand our ability to see our connection to the vast network of being that we're a part of
Now really quick keep in mind what this is not saying this is not saying that we should get rid of the self
Nullifying the self, but it's also moving away from us reifying the self see this is typically how dualistic thinking will work
We think we either need to reify the self and make it into something way more important and durable than it actually is
Kind of like what we do with forms and objects when we reify them
Or if it's not that then we need to nullify the self and get rid of it entirely say something like the self is a total
Illusion or something but no neither of these are what Nishitani is saying again
There is no fixed essence to what this self we're talking about is
Like the point we arrived at towards the end of last episode the thing that makes the self what it is is the emptiness of?
Shunyata so the only way to see that emptiness is to empty the self
Empty the self to empty it as much as we can of all these artifacts from the field of consciousness
Where we're creating these elaborate systems that block us from a deeper connection to night Hility and Shunyata
Yeah, that was easier to just fucking record that than try and work talk through it, but that last bit. That's like that's
in some ways, that's how we awaken from
That's how we remember the being mode
We empty the self of the artifacts that we have filled it up filled it up with
Through this consciousness, which is the having mode I
Understand John Viveki right that's basically how he says that we can
Awaken from the meaning crisis is by remembering the being mode
Awesome. So now he's linking this to Simone Vey and her concept of attention
No, what about the work of the philosopher Simone Vey and her concept of attention?
Simone Vey is gonna be someone whose work is directly related to this whole conversation
We've been having lately and to use one of her examples here and to make this relatable to just use an example of self
Emptying that goes on at the level of a person that's talking to another person
Simone Vey writes about how when you come across someone anyone and start having a conversation with them
There's different
Standpoints that you can be having that conversation from on one hand you can be talking to someone and if you're operating in this field
Of consciousness that Nishitani is talking about you might have the entire conversation with this person
Filtering all of it through what use this person has to you
How does this person benefit my own projects or agendas how is what they're saying here similar to what I already believe in you may
Only consider differences in the way that they view the world in so far as they're commensurate with your ways that you view things
In other words, there's a way to have every conversation you ever find yourself in from a dualistic
Utilitarian framing where you're ultimately just projecting yourself onto this other person
But then there's another way to orient yourself towards this whole process
She says you can talk to a person and just try to listen to them as they are
Where there's no projection of the self that's going on you're really just trying to let them be
You're trying to receive this person on their own terms as they're attempting to present themselves to you
Now that's a totally different kind of process for somebody to be engaged in
And what Simone Vey says happens when you do this is a couple things one you potentially become a catalyst for this person being seen
At a level that they've never really experienced before you becoming catalyst for their own transformation
But more than that when you do this what this turns you into is
Instead of being an ego or a self projecting yourself onto the world
You become more like an antenna for the universe to express itself through you
In other words you become in this moment a node that is a part of a larger network
Your existence becomes about fulfilling a larger role that you always already occupy
Rather than needing to always be dominating and asserting yourself onto every situation
This is a real-world practical example of the kind of move Nishatani is talking about when someone undergoes a religious transformation
This is an everyday life example of self emptying
Where you stop trying so hard to filter this person through all the theories you have about how subjects relate to objects
You stop thinking about them as some object that either gets you closer to or further away from your own goals and
This emptying of the self of these artifacts from the field of consciousness all these tools
We use it opens you up to experiencing this person and even the world at large in a new way more
Immediately or as Nishatani says quote to receive the emptiness of things on their own home ground end quote
Again easier to just record all of that then try and
Talk it out myself, but yeah, yeah all of that
In particular like that that's him that that's at length him
Talk like linking Nishatani and what he's talking about here with Simone Vey and her concept of attention and how we pay attention to others
And I think an important interesting point in there an important point is about how we pay attention to other people
And then that that that becomes like an act of
almost like an act of
transformation and salvation
If we are able to pay attention to others in this
Egoless self like empty in this way where we are we are open to them to them rather than projecting ourselves onto them
It's it becomes almost an act of transformation and salvation. I think
this journey from consciousness through nihility nihility to Shunyata is
kind of what
It seems related to what John to what David Chapman is talking about with the journey from stage 3 from stage 4
through
4.5 which is
post-rational nihilism to stage 5 which is meta rationality where you see the
groundlessness of all of all systems
that's kind of like meta David R Chapman ideas of meta rationality are kind of like
Shunyata applied to
Rational systems
in some ways
And I think I guess what Nishitani is talking about is up is taking that and applying it everywhere not just the rational systems
seeing
like almost stepping outside of or
Being able to see that
All of these systems are ultimately groundless and that they each kind of bring their own
Bring their own set of things
and
You can use different ones
But that they're all ultimately there's there's no there's no one ultimate
System that explains everything because that that's consciousness
It's almost like the search for
That actually that kind of is consciousness. It's it's it's that the quest for certainty
We are constantly which is what he said earlier not that he said earlier. We are constantly looking trying to nail down
the all these things around us that are that are that are groundless and
You know essence formless and empty
And we are trying to nail them all down and force them to to have
form and meaning and all those sorts of things which is that which is
That's the quest for certainty that's eternalism and the quest for certainty and
then
Nihility and by here hasn't got to talking about I know healthy yet, but my hill tea is
It's the other the other side it's it's Nile it's David Chapman's other side which is
Nihilism we move from eternalism to nihilism and we end up at fluidity
Which is going from consciousness through nihility to shun yata
It's all it's all kind of seems like the same thing it's the same underlying pattern
It's moving from
It's recognizing the groundlessness of everything
Having a fucking existential nihilistic breakdown because of it and then coming out the other end
Into fluidity and metta and meta rationality and it's kind of like if I'm relating to what David Chapman says to what?
Relating what David Chapman says to what's
Relating what David Chapman says to what?
Nishitani is talking about
This move
This kind of development
through to
fluidity is
the religious quest
Yeah, and if what if I'm correct in thinking that what John Vivek is talking about with kind of like his version of his
views on rationality and like the Socratic way in the Socratic path and
How that leads us to wisdom?
That's kind of the same thing. That's
It's David Chapman's
Self development development through the stages John Vivek's
Socratic way and it's Nishitani's religious quest
Yeah
