I've just had a thought, thinking about GÃ¶del's Theorem and axioms and stuff.
Is it not - this is kind of a question, it's like I feel like this is the case but it's
still also a question - is it not the case that we arrive at axioms through induction?
Because an axiom is something that is not proven, it's just taken to be true.
But how, on what basis are we taking it to be true?
We're taking it to be true based on our prior experiences and things that make sense to
us based on how the world is, right?
Or how numbers are, etc etc.
And isn't that induction?
Is that not what induction is?
Based on some prior thing, some previous thing, some basis, some previous experience, we are
assuming that x is the case.
So we're using induction to go from prior experience to axioms, but then doesn't that
mean that the problem of induction applies to all axioms?
Which means we can never be certain of the axioms?
