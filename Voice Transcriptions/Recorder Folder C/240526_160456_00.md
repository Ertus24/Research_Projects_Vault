been trying to think about how to have...
thinking about doing a 40k rewrite, concentrating, it was like, I've been thinking about lots
of different things, I was thinking, look, I actually think that in terms of stats and
scales and stuff, 40k, 10th edition's in a pretty good spot, I just think it needs more...
I think I've started off thinking it just needs more gradiation. How do I get that?
Best way to do that is probably using D12 rather than D6, because it uses the same fractions,
which just gives you more gradiation. And then I was trying to think, how do I solve
the... it's a little bit... can be a bit problematic, but the...
the... ah, the strength and toughness scale is elegant, it does work, it works, and it's
easy to remember and it's elegant. And I was just kind of thinking, how would you keep that
while that same sort of thing scheme while moving it to a D12? You couldn't really do...
Well if you're the same strength and toughness, then it's 4+ if it's more than it's... oh
no, it's 7+ if it's more than it's... 8+ if it's 2 times more than it's 9+, etc. etc.
That wouldn't work, because you'd have to have like 3 times, to have any decent chance of
winning, you'd have to have 3 times the toughness, or strength would have to be 3 times the toughness
of the thing. That doesn't work, that scaling doesn't work. One way to solve it would be
to have... have those scales. So yeah, if the strength is versus... strength is the same
as toughness, then you wound on a... strength is the same as toughness, then you wound on
a... 4, if it's... sorry, you wound on a 7+, which is the equivalent of a 4+ on the D6.
If the strength is more than the toughness, you wound on a... if your strength is more
than toughness, you wound on a 9+, which is the equivalent of... sorry, wound on a 5+,
which is the equivalent of a 3+ on a D6. And if your strength is more than their toughness,
it's 2 times more than their toughness, then you wound them on a 3+, which is the equivalent
of a 2+ on a D6. So it works in increments of 2, and then have other things, like a...
a 2, and then have other things that give you + or -1. So the wound scale works in increments
of 2, but have other things that give you + or -1 to your wounding.
Yeah, so you might have... cover gives you... having cover gives you... a 2, and then you
have... cover gives you... having cover gives you... having cover gives you +1 to wound.
Sorry, being in cover means they're at -1 to wound you, which means you're not losing
a hole. It's not like going from a 3+ to a 4+, it's halfway between, etc. etc. That seems
like a good place to start. It also allows for... using that scale, it also allows for
more evasion modifiers in the hit roll. They just use the same thing for hitting. You could
have a... agility or evasion stat. You could have an agility or evasion stat for shooting.
You could have an agility or evasion stat. Are these people alright? Yeah, you could do
the same thing with tip values. You could have like a... something like a ballistic skill
and a... a ballistic skill and evasion stat. Although then you lose the elegance of how
they've done ballistic skill with, you know, heavy weapons being just one less kind of
thing. You could just have... should look, to be honest, I think where they're at with
hitting is... actually works, to be honest. I don't think it's a need for an evasion stat
and all that kind of stuff. You know, and you could do the same thing with hit values.
You could have... they move in twos, up and down by twos. Although it's actually a lot
easier to do than... Alternatively, you could have weapons have... do the agis sigma thing
and have weapons have wound values, but then they get modified by... then they get modified
by... like doffness kind of thing. You know, like you could have... like a gun might have...
weapons skill 3+, wound 4+.
Yeah. Um... yeah, that's a way you could do it. Wound. Yeah, not quite sure.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. Like, you know, maybe your last gun is ballistic skill 4+, the equivalent of
the 6+ of the gun. Ballistic skill 7+, so you've got a half chance of hitting. And...
wound 7+, so you have a half chance of wounding. But then you would have to... you would modify
that based on... yeah, look, I don't know. AP value. You have an AP value. You have...
How could you do that? How could you? Because the... currently, the strength vs. toughness
system is doing the job of target priority. Like what gun's working against what. You
could have multiple ways of doing that. You could have... like epic, you could have classes
of weapons and classes of targets.
