I've just been thinking about it in relation to it's kind of like a bunch of things rattling around
But I've been thinking about it and just realized that it's not what I want. It's not what I want to do. It's not
I would not be happy with this life
but
If this were to be the case, but I have gotten myself to a position
Where I now I could do AP for the rest of my life and
and
Get by
It's not you know, I could I could do what jazz jazz has done. She spent the last 20 years
Raising a family and doing AP and I could do that. I could do that too if if I had to I
Have a set of skills and
An amount of
work experience and some connections
That mean I could now I
Could now do if I had to I could spend the rest of my life doing accounts payable jobs and
You know getting by in life like I would make enough money that I could you know
Get by
Live at least somewhat comfortably
I wouldn't enjoy it. I don't want to spend the rest of my life doing AP
But I have that to fall back on now
No matter what else happens
Yeah, I've got
Maybe don't have enough now to be like, you know at this point maybe if
I've done what two years
Maybe of a kind of AP
I could I could argue that I have done to you about two years of AP
And
I could I
Could
You know
I could I could step away from it for a while and do something else like basically if I was to step away from it
And and you know not do anything if I was to go study for four years
It maybe would be a bit of a hit to the AP path
But it does it but I do you know
I probably need to have started to be you know have like 10 years of experience in AP for
Stepping away and doing no work at all for four years
For that experience to kind of still matter to somebody but where I'm at now, I still have I've got enough
I've got myself to I have have enough experience
Have it have the skill set have the connections that me and you know the references that mean that I could
I could turn I could I have a backup you know I can I could spend six months
Not doing anything and trying to
You know do other things with my time
not not doing anything, but not not working and trying to learn other stuff and
Have AP in my back pocket
As
Like my fallback
You know I just I need a job. I need some money. I'm gonna go get this job
I know I should be able to get that pretty easily
And you know this was all kind of coming up as part of thinking about the fact that maybe I should be getting into IT and
programming after all because I'm at the moment I am building a
I'm using I have some spare time at work, and I'm using that spare time to
Which also is like a really good thing as well to point out like I should absolutely include that on my resume
I had some spare time and
When I wasn't able to fill it with the line. I didn't really have anything else important to do
I filled that time with optimize that like by I took the initiative and filled that filled my time by optimizing
Our regular tasks so there was you know these set of tasks that we constantly would do that all of us that the whole
AP team has to do constantly and we just do the same thing again and again in in the rec sheets and
the wrecking process and I
Took that time and used chat GPT to help me develop a
template a tool that would allow the rest of my team to drastically to to automate like a decent chunk of
What that task that they're doing?
So that we can you know I'm create I create a
Template that they can just run the template that has instructions it has buttons
And all they have to do is press one button is copy in some data
They have to do some formatting of their own and it has to be in a particular format and you know
I'd like to get to the point where I can figure out how to solve that problem
but
You know they can they as long as they do a bit of a bit of pre formatting they can just chuck in the data
Put it into this this statement into this template press one button and it will do the rest
And they can immediately see what's missing where the amounts where amounts are out etc etc
Like the fact that I
One was able to do like the fact that I took the initiative to do that rather than just sitting around twiddling my thumbs
When I didn't have much to do
the fact that I
Was able to create a fucking automated template for my team and the fact that I was able to use chat GPT
AI tools to work out how to do something that I have no idea how to do
I have no idea how to do any of that coding
I'm not aware any of that code means but the fact that I was able to work out how to do it myself
All of those are really important skills. They're very fucking powerful to put on it on a
Very powerful skills to put on a resume and I should absolutely include them
I really want to get this thing done and show it to jazz before I go and
Show her how to use it even though it's a different system to hers
So that one it makes her life better
But so cuz she's one of my mate two main references her and Zabi and if she if I leave that with her
She's you know, like my parting gift is here. Here's this thing that you can just press one button. It does everything for you
That's a that's a good reference of there on top of everything else already that I'm gonna get from that reference
That's a very good reference to have
So
Yeah, so really it feels like it's felt a bit shitty, but these last two years have actually been of
Just doing I'm just working at Eager's
Have actually been really useful
They've given me a really good backup job. They've given me some really good references
They've given me some chances to try some things that I've really enjoyed
They give me some really good like just life kind of like friend basically friend connections
you know, I really really like jazz and Zabi and
They've given me
You know corporate experience. They've given me a for the first time in my life
actually just a
Chunk of time where I've just sat down and done the same job, but for you know, two years
Well, I actually almost three years with the same company which all you know, it's a huge huge company as well. That looks good
but it's corporate experience for myself of of you know, just doing a
not full-time work, but doing
You know a corporate job in a large an office job corporate job in a large company
For a long set of time for a long period of time
That's an important step for me because I never had you know before that it was all other than my time in Korea
it was all just
Fucking shit. It was all
You know, I came back from Korea and was a cleaner
like
This this was an important it was absolutely worth
Stepping away from uni to get this period of experience
Absolutely, I
and
Also now it's got me thinking, you know
the fact the fact that I'm that I'm doing this this thing in my spare time at work and I am enjoying it so much more
than anything else I do in my job is
Maybe a bit and you know, that was the same thing when I built the spreadsheet at
I built the the spreadsheet for everybody at
BYD same kind of thing. I enjoyed that so much more than everything else. I did my job
That's like I'm kind of I'm I'm like
Baby's first budget programmer because I don't actually understand any of the code but I am kind of that's the kind of what I'm doing. I
Should maybe have a chat to Jayden and be like, hey look, this is this is what I'm actually doing
How much is that like being a programmer as a job how much of that do you actually do as a programmer?
Because if so, I probably would actually really maybe enjoy being a programmer
added to that that I'm really interested in in the
philosophy the philosophy and logic the only the the deep foundations of
Programming and computer science
That's like that's actually could make me a really
powerful and effective and
You know
wanted
commodity I guess
But also land also the other way around like doing getting actual experience
learning coding and programming and getting some actual experience in
Getting some actual experience in doing those things could also like
Improve my
my philosophy sort of thing like I'd
It's not just then it's not just abstract like knowledge that I'm interested in it. I've like I've taken that and applied it
And like, you know
I can discuss things so much more understand things and discuss things so much more deeply when I've got both got an
understanding of the found of the
of the
theoretical and philosophical
foundations and
Also, how would actually apply how you actually do it in you know how it actually plays out in real life
we're and all of that is also like
really useful for the project of
Meta rationality given everything fucking David Chapman's talking that talked about with
You know given the example he uses to try and work out meta rationality is programming or it's actually software engineering
But yeah
Yep, and you know understanding meta rationality and bringing that which is cut like
Something that basically nobody is talking about other than David Chapman could make me an incredibly
Useful powerful person in that in that and you know enhance everything
I want to do it could it could it could enhance my whole the whole project
I'm trying to I care about about you know meaning crisis and the response to it of meta rationality
Because it does kind of seem like meta rationality is the response
You know given that it's about kind of like
Stepping beyond rational systems and and understanding that you know
Everything is we're always approaching things from a particular view a particular tool set etc etc
and learning how to it's like the the deep set of skills and in John Vivekis language the kind of like
Relationship between you know
Meta rationality and the whole like fluid relationship with
Rational systems and you're stepping outside of them and knowing when where how why to alter them which ones to use etc
Etc that is an agent arena relationship. That's a fundamentally different agent arena relationship to a
Rationalist who is like hyper focused on one particular rational system
Those are two agent arena relationships two different agent arena relationships
So there is deep deep importance there I think
My life stuff and philosophy stuff constantly combining and also I as part of this I also realized that I
Also realized the relationship that there's a relationship. I think I've maybe talked about this before but I realized there's a relationship between
Expertise and relevance realization and how that happened was that I realized that I'm really enjoying doing it
I realized that I'm really enjoying doing you know
What I'm doing at the moment at work with using chat GPT to learn you know to create the code for me to
Do these all these things is really it's good and it's pounce. It's cool
But I was thinking like you know
And it's kind of like good for a company for somebody at full-on for somebody who's not a programmer to be able to do that
But I was also thinking like yeah, yeah, this is really cool
And it's a good skill set I have and praise me for it basically not that anybody will
But you know when shit hits the fan you're gonna want an actual programmer like I am baby's first budget programmer here
I don't know what any of this code does. I don't understand any of it. I don't understand the underlying language
You know if things went wrong
Here it would probably I could work it out. I could get chap GPT to walk through every
Single line of code and explain to me what it does and use that to then probably logically work out what whether whether
Any problems are arising from but it would take me a long fucking time like I would probably
It would probably take me weeks at least a week to work through the level of the coat the amount of code
I've already got
Just to fix that one tiny little simple problem. You know bit of code
Jaden could probably sit down and look at that code and know what the problem is and how to fix it within a minute
and that's the difference between expertise between
novice and expertise and
that difference
It's maybe not all there is to the difference, but a big part of that difference is relevance
Jaden knows the relevant things to look at he knows the relevant information to find to look for to you know
All of that stuff
So there's a big relationship between expertise and relevance realization in some ways relevance expertise is having
Trained relevance realization in a particular domain or field or area. That's kind of what expertise is
Yes
