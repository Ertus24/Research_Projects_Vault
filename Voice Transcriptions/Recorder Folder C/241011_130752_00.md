of what I'm talking to the therapist about, whether I'm going up on meds or coming off
of the meds, and more importantly, I've been getting a recommendation for somebody of GP
to see from her about that, and more importantly, what's underlying my desire to come off the
meds, which is I am terrified of feeling apathetic about going to the UK. That's something I
need to unpack with her, and all my feelings around the apathy and all that kind of stuff.
The other thing, if there's time, is talking about the stuff that's happening with work,
and the relational stuff that's happening there.
