So I'm thinking about how to, um, thinking about how to create, so I want to run a shared
campaign, a long-term shared campaign that links together Battlefleet Gothic, Epic,
40K and Kilting, and possibly also run a Imperium Maledictum campaign that's linked
to it.
Um, like, like, in the same setting kind of thing, or nearby, so it's like things that
happen in the wargame campaign affect the, or like, are happening in the background of
the Imperium Maledictum campaign.
Um, but I need to, in terms of the wargame campaign that links the four games together,
I want to find a way where, one, people can, um, people can, um, drop in and drop out,
for one, so, you know, they don't have to commit to always being there for every game,
so that, you know, if people can't make it for some games, they can still be part of,
they can still partake in the campaign, but not, yeah, like, you know, a system to, like,
you know, auto-resolve battles if, you know, if one person attacks another person's territory
and the other person can't.
If person A attacks person B's territory, then person B can't be there, so there's
a way to resolve that. Um, a way for, to kind of, like, automate what a person does if they
can't make it for, you know, like, for a campaign turn, that kind of thing. Um, and a way to
integrate progression, you know, like the, um, you know, the 40k crusade rules and the,
uh, Battlefleet Gothic campaign rules and all that kind of stuff, a way to sort of,
um, for those, for, you know, like, experience, for units to gain experience and all that
kind of stuff and for that to be shared across the different games and for the, uh, effects
of different games to affect each other and the experience of, you know, the experiences
to affect each other, um, and all that kind of stuff. So that's something I need to come
up with and, um, I've got these, I've got, uh, I've got a campaign, an expanded campaign
rule set for Battlefleet Gothic. I've got the, um, I've got this crusade for 40k. There's
kind of, uh, a campaign system for epic, for 40k for Kill Team, although that needs to
be expanded on. And there's a, sounds like a lot to track to be honest, but, um, and there's
a, uh, kind of a, yeah, campaign system for Kill Team. I need to find a campaign system
with XP and stuff for, um, for epic. And then I need to find a way to integrate all of those
together and like a resource system and a tracking system, which is kind of what Galactic
Conquest is. Uh, and then, if Galactic Conquest doesn't have it, then that guy's, um, Promethium,
to called, yeah Promethium, that guy's Promethium rule set can be kind of maybe the way to auto
resolve battles. Yeah. And then use chat GPT. I kind of want to find a way to like track
what is happening in a game, in each of those games. Particularly if they're happening on,
uh, tabletop CBR, and then input that information, that tracking what's happening within individual
games, like battle reports kind of thing. Track that and put that into, almost like
a system to track the individual moves that happened, you know, what attacked what in
a game and how much damage things did and all that. And then input that into chat GPT
and use that to like create battle reports. And then use chat GPT to kind of link all
the different battle reports together. And an important thing as well is that there will
be a work in progress. Like, um, need to be able to, um, you know, make mistakes and then
like get feedback from the players kind of thing. Nobody's fucking doing it.
